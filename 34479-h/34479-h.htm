<h4 class="p4">ADVERTISEMENT.</h4>

<p class="p2">After the very copious and excellent remarks upon the
objects of the present history contained in the Author's Preface, the
Translator feels that it would be useless on his part to add any further
explanation.</p>

<p>It would not be right, however, to close these volumes without some
acknowledgment of the valuable assistance he has received. Amongst
others, he is particularly indebted to Dr. Traill, of Liverpool, who
after proceeding to some length with a translation of this work, kindly
placed what he had completed in the hands of the Translator, with
liberty to make such use of it as might be deemed advantageous to the
present undertaking. To Mr. W. Y. Ottley, who also contemplated, and in
part executed, a version of the same author, the Translator has to
express his obligations for several explanations of terms of art, which
the intimacy of that gentleman with the fine arts, in all their
branches, peculiarly qualifies him to impart.<a name="fnanchor_1"
id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Similar acknowledgments are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pag_iv"
id="Pag_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> due to an enlightened and learned
foreigner, Mr. Panizzi, of Liverpool, for his kind explanation of
various obscure phrases and doubtful passages.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the anxious desire and unremitting endeavours of the
Translator to render this work, in all instances, as accurate as the
nature of the subject, and the numerous difficulties he had to surmount
would allow, yet, in dismissing it from his hands, he cannot repress the
feeling that he must throw himself upon the indulgence of the public to
excuse such errors as may be discoverable in the text. He trusts,
however, that where it may be found incorrect, it will for the most part
be in those passages where doubtful terms of art lay in his way,
intelligible only to the initiated, and which perhaps many of the
countrymen of Lanzi themselves might not be able very readily to
explain.</p>

<h4 class="p4">PREFACE.</h4>

<p class="p2">When detached or individual histories become so numerous
that they can neither be easily collected nor perused, the public
interest requires a writer capable of arranging and embodying them in
the form of a general historical narrative; not, indeed, by a minute
detail of their whole contents, but by selecting from each that which
appears most interesting and instructive. Hence it mostly happens, that
the diffuse compositions of earlier ages are found to give place to
compendiums, and to succinct history. If this desire has prevailed in
former times, it has been, and now is, more especially the
characteristic of our own. We live in an age highly favourable, in one
sense at least, to the cultivation of intellect: the boundaries of
science are now extended beyond what our forefathers could have hoped,
much less foreseen; and we become anxious only to discover the readiest
methods of obtaining a competent knowledge, at least, of several
sciences, since it is impossible to acquire them all. On the other hand,
the ages <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg
ii]</a></span>preceding ours, since the revival of learning, being more
occupied about words than things, and admiring certain objects that now
seem trivial to the generality of readers, have produced historical
compositions, the separate nature of which demands combination, no less
than their prolixity requires abridgment.</p>

<p>If these observations are applicable to other branches of history,
they are especially so to the history of painting. Its materials are
found ready prepared, scattered through numerous memoirs of artists of
every school which, from time to time, have been given to the public:
and additional articles are supplied by dictionaries of art, letters on
painting, guides to several cities, catalogues of various collections,
and by many tracts relating to different artists, which have been
published in Italy. But these accounts, independent of want of
connexion, are not useful to the generality of readers. Who, indeed,
could form a just idea of painting in Italy by perusing the works of
certain historians of latter ages, and some even of our own time, which
abound in invectives, and in attempts to exalt favourite masters above
the artists of all other schools; and which confer eulogies
indiscriminately upon professors of first, second, or third-rate
merit?<a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> How few are there who feel<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>
interested in knowing all that is said of artists with so much verbosity
by Vasari, Pascoli, or Baldinucci; their low jests, their amours, their
private affairs, and their eccentricities? What do we learn by being
informed of the jealousies of the Florentine artists, the quarrels of
the Roman, or the boasts of the Bolognian schools? Who can endure the
verbal accuracy with which their wills and testaments are recorded, even
to the subscription of the notary, as if the author had been drawing up
a legal document; or the descriptions of their stature and physiognomy,
more minute than the ancients afford us of Alexander or Augustus?<a
name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Not that I object to the introduction of such
particulars in the lives of the great luminaries of art: in a Raffaello
or a Caracci minute circumstances derive interest from the subject; but
how intolerable do they become <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv"
id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>in the life of an ordinary individual,
where the principal incidents are but little interesting? Suetonius has
not written the lives of his Cæsars and his grammarians in the same
manner: the former he has rendered familiar to the reader; the latter
are merely noticed and passed over.</p>

<p>The tastes of individuals, however, are different, and some people
delight in minutiæ, as it regards both the present and the past; and
since it may be of utility to those who may hereafter be inclined to
give a very full and perfect history of every thing relating to Italian
painting, let us view with indulgence those who have employed themselves
in compiling lives so copious, and let those who have time to spare,
beguile it with their perusal. At the same time, due regard should be
paid to that very respectable class of readers, who, in a history of
painting, would rather contemplate the artist than the man; and who are
less solicitous to become acquainted with the character of a single
painter, whose solitary and insulated history cannot prove instructive,
than with the genius, the method, the invention, and the style of a
great number of artists, with their characteristics, their merits, and
their rank, the result of which is a history of the whole art.</p>

<p>To this object there is no one whom I know who has hitherto dedicated
his pen, although it seems to be recommended no less by the passion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg
v]</a></span>indulged by princes for the fine arts, than by the general
diffusion of a knowledge of them among all ranks. The habit of
travelling, rendered more familiar to private persons by the example of
many great sovereigns, the traffic in pictures, now become a branch of
commerce important to Italy, and the philosophic genius of this age,
which shuns prolixity in every study, and requires systematic
arrangement, are additional incentives to the task. It is true that very
pleasing and instructive biographical sketches of the most celebrated
painters have been published by M. d'Argenville, in France; and various
epitomes have since appeared, in which the style of painting alone is
discussed.<a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But without taking into account the corruptions
of the names of our countrymen in which their authors have indulged, or
their omission of celebrated Italians, while they record less eminent
artists of other countries, no work of this sort, and still less any
dictionary, can afford us a systematic history of painting: none of
these exhibit those pictures, if we may be allowed the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
expression, in which we may, at a glance, trace the progress and series
of events; none of them exhibit the principal masters of the art in a
sufficiently conspicuous point of view, while inferior artists are
reduced to their proper size and station: far less can we discover in
them those epochs and revolutions of the art, which the judicious reader
most anxiously desires to know, as the source from which he may trace
the causes that have contributed to its revival or its decline; or from
which he may be enabled to recollect the series, and the arrangement of
the facts narrated. The history of painting has a strong analogy to
literary, to civil, and to sacred history; it too requires, from time to
time, the aid of certain beacons, some particular distinction in regard
to places, times, or events, that may serve to divide it into epochs,
and mark its successive stages. Deprive it of these, and it degenerates,
like other history, into a chaos of names more calculated to load the
memory than to inform the understanding.</p>

<p>To supply this hitherto neglected branch of Italian history, to
contribute to the advancement of the art, and to facilitate the study of
the different styles in painting, were the three objects I proposed to
myself when I began the work which I am now about to lay before the
indulgent reader. My intention was to form a compendious history of all
our schools, in two volumes; adopting, with <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>little variation,
Pliny's division of the country into Upper and Lower Italy. It was my
design to comprehend in the first volume the schools of Lower Italy;
because in it the reviving arts came earlier to maturity; and in the
second to include the schools of Upper Italy, which were more tardy in
attaining to celebrity. The first part of my work appeared at Florence
in 1792: the second I was obliged to defer to another opportunity, and
the succeeding years have so shaken my constitution, that I have
scarcely been able to bring it to a conclusion, even with the assistance
of many amanuenses and correctors of the press.<a name="fnanchor_5"
id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> One
advantage, however, has been derived from this delay; and that is, a
knowledge of the opinion of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii"
id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>the public, a tribunal from which no
writer can appeal; and I have been thus enabled to prepare a new edition
conformable to its decision.<a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a
href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I have understood through
various channels, that an additional number of names and of notices were
necessary to afford satisfaction to the public; and this I have
accomplished, without abandoning my plan of a compendious history. Nor
does the Florentine edition on this account become useless: it will even
be preferred by many to that published at Bassano; the inhabitants, for
instance, of Lower Italy will be pleased to possess a work on their most
illustrious painters, without concerning themselves about accounts of
other places.</p>

<p>To a new work, then, so much more extensive than the former, I prefix
a preface almost entirely new. The plan is not wholly my own, nor
altogether that of others. Richardson<a name="fnanchor_7"
id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
suggested that some historian should collect the scattered remarks on
art, especially on painting, and should point out its progress and
decline through successive ages. He has not even omitted to give us a
sketch, which he brought down to the time of Giordano. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>Mengs<a
name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> accomplished the task more perfectly in the
form of a letter, where he judiciously distinguished all the periods of
the art, and has thus laid the foundations of a more enlarged history.
Were I to follow their example, the chief masters of every school would
be considered together, and we should be under the necessity of passing
from one country to another, according as painting acquired a new lustre
from their talents, or was debased by a wrong use of the great example
of those artists. This method might be easily pursued, if the subject
were to be treated in a general point of view, such as Pliny has
considered and transmitted it to posterity; but it is not equally
adapted to the arrangement of a history so fully particular as Italy
seems to require. Besides the styles introduced by the most celebrated
painters, such infinite diversities of a mixed character, often united
with originality of manner, have arisen in every school, that we cannot
easily reduce them to any particular standard: and the same artists at
different periods, and in different pictures, have adopted styles so
various, that at one time they appear imitators of Titian, at another of
Raffaello, or of Correggio. We cannot, therefore, adopt the method of
the naturalist, who having arranged the vegetable kingdom, for example,
in classes more or less numerous, according to the systems of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>Tournefort
or of Linnæus, can easily reduce a plant, wherever it may happen to
grow, to a particular class, adding a name and description, at once
precise, characteristic, and permanent. In a complete history it is
necessary to distinguish each style from every other: nor do I know any
more eligible method of performing this task, than by composing a
separate history of each school. In this I follow Winckelmann, the best
historian of ancient art in design, who specified as many different
schools as the nations that produced them. A similar plan seems to me to
have been pursued by Rollin, in his History of Nations, who has thus
been enabled to record a prodigious mass of names and events within the
compass of a few volumes, in the clearest order.</p>

<p>The method I follow in treating of each school is analogous to that
prescribed to himself by Sig. Antonio Maria Zanetti,<a name="fnanchor_9"
id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in
his <i>Pittura Veneziana</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi"
id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>a work of its kind highly instructive,
and well arranged. What he has done, in speaking of his own, I have
attempted in the other schools of Italy. I accordingly omit the names of
living painters, and do not notice every picture of deceased artists, as
it would interrupt the connexion of the narrative, and would render the
work too voluminous, but content myself with commending some of their
best productions. I first give a general character of each school; I
then distinguish it into three, four, or more epochs, according as its
style underwent changes with the change of taste, in the same way that
the eras of civil history are deduced from revolutions in governments,
or other remarkable events. A few celebrated painters, who have swayed
the public taste, and given a new tone to the art, are placed at the
head of each epoch; and their style is particularly described, because
the general and characteristic taste of the age has been formed upon
their models. Their immediate pupils, and other disciples of the school,
follow their great masters; and without a repetition of the general
character, reference is made to what each has borrowed, altered, or
added to the style of the founder of the school, or at most such
character is cursorily noticed. This method, though not susceptible of a
strict chronological order, is, on account of the connexion of ideas,
much better adapted to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii"
id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>a history of art than an alphabetic
arrangement, which too frequently interrupts the notices of schools and
eras; or than the method pursued in annals, by which we are often
compelled to make mention of the scholar before the master, should he
survive the former; or that of separate lives, which introduces much
repetition, by obliging the writer to bestow praises on the pupil for
the same style which he also commends in the master, and to notice in
each individual that which was the general character of the age in which
he lived.</p>

<p>For the sake of perspicuity, I have generally separated from
historical painters artists in inferior branches, such as painters of
portraits, of landscape, of animals, of flowers and of fruit, of
sea-pieces, of perspectives, of drolls, and all who merit a place in
such classes. I have also taken notice of some arts which are analogous
to painting, and though they differ from it in the materials employed,
or the manner of using them, may still be included in the art; for
example, engraving of prints, inlaid and mosaic work, and embroidering
tapestry. Vasari, Lomazzo, and several other writers on the fine arts,
have mentioned them; and I have followed their example; contenting
myself with noticing, in each of those arts, only what has appeared most
worthy of being recorded. Each might be the subject of a separate work;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg
xiii]</a></span>and some of them have long had their own peculiar
historians, and in particular the art of engraving. By this method, in
which I may boast such great examples, I am not without hopes of
affording satisfaction to my readers. I am, however, more apprehensive
in regard to my selection of artists; the number of whom, whatsoever
method is adopted, may to some appear by far too limited, and to others
too greatly extended. But criticism will not so readily apply to the
names of the most illustrious artists, whom I have included, nor to
those of very inferior character, whom I trust I have omitted; except a
few that have some claim to be mentioned, from their connexion with
celebrated masters.<a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a
href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The accusation then of
having noticed some, and omitted others, will apply to me only on
account of artists of a middle class, that can be neither well reckoned
among the senate, the equestrian order, nor vulgar herd of painters;
they constitute the class of mediocrity. The adjustment of limits is a
frequent cause of legal contention; and the subject of art now under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg
xiv]</a></span>discussion, may be considered like a dispute concerning
boundaries. It may often admit of doubt whether a particular artist
approaches more nearly to the class of merit or of insignificance; which
is, in other words, whether he should or should not obtain a place in a
history of the art. Under such uncertainty, which I have several times
encountered, I have more usually inclined to the side of lenity than of
severity; especially when the artist has been noticed with a degree of
commendation by former authors. We ought to bow to public opinion, which
rarely blames us for noticing mediocrity, but frequently for passing it
over in silence. Books on painting abound with complaints against
Orlandi and Guarienti, for their omissions of certain artists. Still
more frequently are authors censured, when the Guide to a city points
out some altar-piece by a native artist, who is not named in our
Dictionaries of Painting. The describers of collections repeat similar
complaints in regard to every painting bearing the signature of an
artist whose name appears in no work of art. Collectors of prints do the
same when they discover the name of some designer, of whom history is
silent, affixed to an engraving. Thus, were we to consult the opinion of
the public, the majority would be inclined to recommend copiousness,
rather than to express satisfaction at a more discriminating <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg
xv]</a></span>selection of names. Almost all artists and amateurs
belonging to every city, would be desirous that I should commemorate as
many of their second rate painters as possible; and our selection,
therefore, in this respect, nearly resembles the exercise of justice,
which is generally applauded as long as it visits only the dwellings of
others, but is cried down by each individual when it knocks at his own
door. Thus a writer who is bound to observe impartiality towards every
city, can scarcely shew great severity to artists of mediocrity in any.
This too is not without reason; for to pass mediocrity in silence may be
the study of a good orator, but not the office of a good historian.
Cicero himself, in his treatise <i>De claris Oratoribus</i>, has given a
place to less eloquent orators, and it may be observed that, after this
example, the literary history of every people does not merely include
its most classic writers, and those who approached nearest to them; but
it adds short and concise accounts of authors less celebrated; and in
the Iliad, which is a history of the heroic age, there are a few eminent
leaders, many valiant soldiers, and a prodigious crowd of others, whom
the poet has transiently noticed. In our case, it is still more
incumbent on the historian to give mediocrity a place along with the
eminent and most excellent. Many books describe that class in terms so
vague, and sometimes <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi"
id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>so discordant, that to form a proper
estimate of their claims, we must introduce them among superior artists,
as a sort of performers in third-rate parts. Such, however, I am not
solicitous to exhibit very minutely, more especially when treating of
painters in fresco, and generally of other artists, whose works are now
unknown in collections, or add more to the bulk than the ornament of a
gallery. Thus also in point of number, my work has maintained the
character of a compendium: but if any of my readers, adopting the rigid
maxim of Bellori, that, in the fine arts, as in poetry, mediocrity is
not to be tolerated,<a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a
href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> should disdain the middle
class of artists, he must look <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii"
id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>for the heads of schools, and for the
most eminent painters: to these he may dedicate his attention, and turn
his regard from the others like one,</p>

<p>Having described my plan, let us next consider the three objects
originally proposed, of which the first was to present Italy with a
history that may prove important to her fame. This delightful country is
already indebted to Tiraboschi for a history of her literature, but she
is still in want of a history of her arts. The history of painting, an
art in which she is confessedly without a rival, I propose to supply, or
at least to facilitate the attempt. In some departments of literature,
and of the fine arts, we are equalled, or even surpassed by foreigners;
and in others the palm is yet doubtful: but in painting, universal
consent now yields the triumph to Italian genius, and foreigners are the
more esteemed in proportion to their approach towards us. It is time
then, for the honour of Italy, to collect in one point of view, those
observations on her painting, scattered through upwards of a hundred
volumes, and to embody them in what Horace terms <i>series et
junctura</i>; without which the work cannot be pronounced a history. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg
xviii]</a></span>will not conceal, that the author of the "History of
Italian Literature" above mentioned, frequently animated me to this
undertaking, as a sequel to his own work. He also wished me to subjoin
other anecdotes to those already published, and to substitute more
authentic documents for the inaccuracies abounding in our Dictionaries
of painting. I have attended to both these objects. The reader will here
find various schools never hitherto illustrated, and an entire school,
that of Ferrara, now first described from the manuscripts of Baruffaldi
and of Crespi; and in other schools he will often observe names of fresh
artists, which I have either collected from ancient MSS.<a
name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13"
class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and the correspondence of my learned friends,
or deciphered on old paintings. Although such pictures are confined to
cabinets, it cannot prove useless to extend a more intimate acquaintance
with their authors. The reader will also meet with many new observations
on the origin of painting, and on its diffusion in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg
xix]</a></span>Italy, formerly a fruitful subject of debate and
contention; and likewise here and there with some original reflections
on the masters, to whom various disciples may be traced; a branch of
history, the most uncertain of any. Old writers of respectability often
mention Raffaello, Correggio, or some other celebrated artist, as the
master of a painter, without any better foundation than a similarity of
style; just as the credulous heathens imagined one hero to be the son of
Hercules, because he was strong; another of Mercury, because he was
ingenious; a third of Neptune, because he had performed several long
voyages. Errors like these are easily corrected when they are
accompanied by some inadvertency in the writer; as for instance, where
he has not been aware that the age of the disciple does not correspond
with that of his supposed master. Occasionally, however, their detection
is attended with more difficulty; and in particular when the artist,
whose reputation is wholly founded upon that of his master, represented
himself in foreign parts, as the disciple of men of celebrity, whom he
scarcely knew by sight. Of this we have an example in Agostino Tassi,
and more recently in certain <i>soidisant</i> disciples of Mengs; to
whom it scarcely appears that he ever so much as said, "<i>Gentlemen,
how do you do</i>?"</p>

<p>Finally, the reader will find some less obvious notices relating to
the name, the country, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx"
id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>the age of different artists. The
deficiency of our Dictionaries in interesting names, together with their
inaccuracy, are common subjects of complaint. I can excuse the compilers
of these works; I know how easily we may be misled in regard to names
which have been often gathered from vulgar report, or even from authors
who differ in point of orthography, some giving opposite readings of the
same name. But it is quite necessary that such mistakes should once for
all be cleared up. The index of this work will form a new Dictionary of
Painters, certainly more copious, and perhaps more accurate than usual,
although it might be still further improved, especially by consulting
archives and manuscripts.<a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a
href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg
xxi]</a></span>The second object which I had in view was to advance the
interests of the art as much as lay in my power. It was of old observed
that examples have a more powerful influence on the arts than any
precepts can possess; and this is particularly true in respect to
painting. Whoever writes history upon the model of the learned ancients,
ought not only to narrate events, but to investigate their secret
sources and their causes. Now these will be here developed, tracing the
progress of painting as it advanced or declined in each school; and
these causes being invariable, point out the means of its improvement,
by shewing what ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii"
id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> pursued and what avoided. Such
observations are not of importance to the artist alone, but have a
reference also to other individuals. In the Roman school, during its
second epoch, I perceive that the progress of the arts invariably
depends on certain principles universally adopted in that age, according
to which artists worked, and the public decided. A general history, by
pointing out the best maxims of art, may contribute considerably to make
them known and regarded; and hence artists can execute, and others
approve or direct, on principles no longer uncertain and questionable,
nor deduced from the manner of a particular school, but founded on
maxims unerring and established, and strengthened by the uniform
practice of all schools and all ages. We may add, that in a history so
diversified, numerous examples occur suited to the genius of different
students, who have often to lament their want of success from this
circumstance alone, that they had neglected to follow the path in which
nature had destined them to tread. On the influence of examples I shall
add no more: should any one be desirous also of precepts under every
school, he will find them given, not indeed by me, but by those who have
written more ably on the art, and whom I have diligently consulted with
regard to different masters, as I shall hereafter mention.</p>

<p>My third object was to facilitate an acquaintance with the various
styles of painting. The artist or <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>amateur indeed,
who has studied the manner of all ages and of every school, on meeting
with a picture can very readily assign it, if not to a particular
master, at least to a certain style, much as antiquarians, from a
consideration of the paper and the characters, are enabled to assign a
manuscript to a particular era; or as critics conjecture the age and
place in which an anonymous author flourished, from his phraseology.
With similar lights we proceed to investigate the school and era of
artists; and by a diligent examination of prints, drawings, and other
relics belonging to the period, we at length determine the real author.
Much of the uncertainty, with regard to pictures, arises from a
similitude between the style of different masters: these I collect
together under one head, and remark in what one differs from the other.
Ambiguity often arises from comparing different works of the same
painter, when the style of some of them does not seem to accord with his
general manner, nor with the great reputation he may have acquired. On
account of such uncertainty, I usually point out the master of each
artist, because all at the outset imitate the example offered by their
teachers; and I, moreover, note the style formed, and adhered to by
each, or abandoned for another manner; I sometimes mark the age in which
he lived, and his greater or less assiduity in his profession. By an
attentive consideration of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv"
id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>such circumstances, we may avoid
pronouncing a picture spurious, which may have been painted in old age,
or negligently executed. Who, for instance, would receive as genuine all
the pictures of Guido, were it not known that he sometimes affected the
style of Caracci, of Calvart, or of Caravaggio; and at other times
pursued a manner of his own, in which, however, he was often very
unequal, as he is known to have painted three or four different pieces
in a single day? Who would suppose that the works of Giordano were the
production of the same artist, if it were not known that he aspired to
diversify his style, by adopting the manner of various ancient artists?
These are indeed well known facts, but how many are there yet unnoted
that are not unworthy of being related, if we wish to avoid falling into
error? Such will be found noticed in my work, among other anecdotes of
the various masters, and the different styles.</p>

<p>I am aware that to become critically acquainted with the diversity of
styles is not the ultimate object to which the travels and the eager
solicitude of the connoisseur aspire. His object is to make himself
familiar with the handling of the most celebrated masters, and to
distinguish copies from originals. Happy should I be, could I promise to
accomplish so much! Even they might consider themselves fortunate, who
dedicate their lives to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv"
id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>such pursuits, were they enabled to
discover any short, general, and certain rules for infallibly
determining this delicate point! Many rely much upon history for the
truth. But how frequently does it happen that the authority of an
historian is cited in favour of a family picture, or an altar-piece, the
original of which having been disposed of by some of the predecessors,
and a copy substituted in its place, the latter is supposed to be a
genuine painting! Others seem to lay great stress on the importance of
places, and hesitate to raise doubts respecting any specimen they find
contained in royal and select galleries, assuming that they really
belong to the artists referred to in the gallery descriptions and
catalogues. But here too they are liable to mistake; inasmuch as many
private individuals, as well as princes, unable to purchase ancient
pictures at any price, contented themselves with such copies of their
imitators as approached nearest to the old masters. Some indeed were
made by professors purposely despatched by princes in search of them; as
in the instance of Rodolph I., who employed Giuseppe Enzo, a celebrated
copyist. (See Boschini, p. 62, and Orlandi, on Gioseffo Ains di Berna.)
External proofs, therefore, are insufficient, without adding a knowledge
of different manners. The acquisition of such discrimination is the
fruit only of long experience, and deep reflection on the style of each
master: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg
xxvi]</a></span>and I shall endeavour to point out the manner in which
it may be obtained.<a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a
href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>To judge of a master we must attend to his design, and this is to be
acquired from his drawings, from his pictures, or, at least, from
accurate engravings after them. A good connoisseur in prints is more
than half way advanced in the art of judging pictures; and he who aims
at this must study engravings with unremitting assiduity. It is thus his
eye becomes familiarized to the artist's method of delineating and
foreshortening the figure, to the air of his heads and the casting of
his draperies; to that action, that peculiarity of conception, of
disposing, and of contrasting, which are habitual to his character. Thus
is he, as it were, introduced to the different families of youths, of
children, of women, of old men, and of individuals in the vigour of
life, which each artist has adopted as his own, and has usually
exhibited in his pictures. We cannot be too well versed in such matters,
so minute or almost insensible are the distinctions between the
imitators of one master, (such as Michelangiolo, for example,) who have
perhaps studied the same cartoon, or the same statues, and, as it were,
learned to write after the same model.</p>

<p>More originality is generally to be discovered in<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg
xxvii]</a></span> colouring, a branch of the art formed by a painter
rather on his own judgment, than by instruction. The amateur can never
attain experience in this branch who has not studied many pictures by
the same master; who has not observed his selection of colours, his
method of separating, of uniting, and of subduing them; what are his
local tints, and what the general tone that harmonizes the colours he
employs. This tint, however clear and silvery in Guido and his
followers, bright and golden in Titiano and his school, and thus of the
rest, has still as many modifications as there are masters in the art.
The same remark extends to middle tints and to chiaroscuro, in which
each artist employs a peculiar method.</p>

<p>These are qualities which catch the eye at a distance, yet they will
not always enable the critic to decide with certainty; whether, for
instance, a certain picture is the production of Vinci, or Luini, who
imitated him closely; whether another be an original picture by Barocci,
or an exact copy from the hand of Vanni. In such cases judges of art
approach closer to the picture with a determination to examine it with
the same care and accuracy as are employed in a judicial question, upon
the recognition of hand-writing. Fortunately for society, nature has
granted to every individual a peculiar character in this respect, which
it is not easy to counterfeit, nor to mistake <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>for any other
person's writing. The hand, habituated to move in a peculiar manner,
always retains it: in old age the characters may be more slowly traced,
may become more negligent or more heavy; but the form of the letters
remains the same. So it is in painting. Every artist not only retains
this peculiarity, but one is distinguished by a full charged pencil;
another by a dry but neat finish; the work of one exhibits blended
tints, that of another distinct touches; and each has his own manner of
laying on the colours:<a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a
href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> but even in regard to what
is common to so many, each has a peculiar handling and direction of the
pencil, a marking of his lines more or less waved, more or less free,
and more or less studied, by which those truly skilled from long
experience are enabled, after a due consideration of all circumstances,
to decide who was the real author. Such judges do<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
not fear a copyist, however excellent. He will, perhaps, keep pace with
his model for a certain time, but not always; he may sometimes shew a
free, but commonly a timid, servile, and meagre pencil; he will not be
long able, with a free hand, to keep his own style concealed under the
manner of another, more especially in regard to less important points,
such as the penciling of the hair, and in the <ins title="not hyphenated
in the original">fore- and back-grounds</ins> of the picture.<a
name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Certain observations on the canvas and the
priming ground may sometimes assist inquiry; and hence some have
endeavoured to attain greater certainty by a chemical analysis of the
colours. Diligence is ever laudable when exerted on a point so nice as
ascertaining the hand-work of a celebrated master. It may prevent our
paying ten guineas for what may not be worth two; or placing in a choice
collection pictures that will not do it credit; while to the curious it
affords scientific views, instead of creating prejudices that often
engender errors. That mistakes should happen is not surprising. A true
connoisseur is still more rare than a good artist. His skill is the
result of only indirect application; it is acquired amidst other
pursuits, and divides the attention with other objects; the means of
attaining it fall to the lot of few; and still fewer practise it
successfully. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg
xxx]</a></span>Among the number of the last I do not reckon myself. By
this work I pretend not, I repeat it, to form an accomplished
connoisseur in painting: my object is to facilitate and expedite the
acquisition of such knowledge. The history of painting is the basis of
connoisseurship; by combining it, I supersede the necessity of referring
to many books; by abbreviating it I save the time and labour of the
student; and by arranging it in a proper manner on every occasion, I
present him with the subject ready prepared and developed before
him.</p>

<p>It remains, in the last place, that I should give some account of
myself; of the criticisms that I, who am not an artist, have ventured to
pass upon each painter: and, indeed, if the professors of the art had as
much leisure and experience in writing as they have ability, every
author might resign to them the field. The propriety of technical terms,
the abilities of artists, and the selection of specimens of art, are
usually better understood, even by an indifferent artist, than by the
learned connoisseur: but since those occupied in painting have not
sufficient leisure to write, others, assisted by them, may be permitted
to undertake the office.<a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a
href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg
xxxi]</a></span>By the mutual assistance which the painter has afforded
to the man of letters, and the man of letters to the artist, the history
of painting has been greatly advanced. The merits of the best painters
are already so ably discussed that a modern historian can treat the
subject advantageously. The criticisms I most regard are those that come
directly from professors of the art. We meet with few from the pen of
Raphael, of Titian, of Poussin, and of other great masters; such as
exist, however, I regard as most precious, and deserving the most
careful preservation; for, in general, those who can best perform can
likewise judge the best. Vasari, Lomazzo, Passeri, Ridolfi, Boschini,
Zanotti, and Crespi, require, perhaps, to be narrowly watched in some
passages where they allowed themselves to be surprised by a spirit of
party: but, on the whole, they have an undoubted right to dictate to us,
because they were themselves painters. Bellori, Baldinucci, Count
Malvasia, Count Tassi, and similar writers, hold an inferior rank; but
are not wholly destitute of authority: for though mere
<i>dilettanti</i>, they have collected <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>both the opinions
of professors and of the public. This will at present suffice, with
regard to the historians of the art: we shall notice each of them
particularly under the school which he has described.</p>

<p>In pronouncing a criticism upon each artist I have adopted the plan
of Baillet, the author of a voluminous history of works on taste, where
he does not so frequently give his own opinion as that of others.
Accordingly, I have collected the various remarks of connoisseurs, which
were scattered through the pages of history; but I have not always cited
my authorities, lest I should add too much to the dimensions of my
book;<a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19"
class="fnanchor">[19]</a> nor have I regarded their opinion when they
seemed to me to have been influenced by prejudice. I have availed myself
of the observations of some approved critics, like Borghini, Fresnoy,
Richardson, Bottari, Algarotti, Lazzarini, and Mengs; with others who
have rather criticised our painters than written their lives. I have
also respected the opinions of<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span> living
critics, by consulting different professors in Italy: to them I have
submitted my manuscript; I have followed their advice, especially when
it related to design, or any other department of painting, in which
artists are almost the only adequate judges. I have conversed with many
connoisseurs, who, in some points, are not less skilful than the
professors of the art, and are even consulted by artists with advantage;
as, for instance, on the suitableness of the subject, on the propriety
of the invention and the expression, on the imitation of the antique, on
the truth of the colouring. Nor have I failed to study the greatest part
of the best productions of the schools of Italy; and to inform myself in
the different cities what rank their least known painters hold among
their connoisseurs; persuaded, as I am, that the most accurate opinion
of any artist is formed where the greatest number of his works are to be
seen, and where he is most frequently spoken of by his fellow citizens
and by strangers. In this way, also, I have been enabled to do justice
to the merits of several artists who had been passed over, either
because the historian of their school had never beheld their
productions, or had merely met with some early and trivial specimens in
one city, being unacquainted with the more perfect and mature specimens
they had produced elsewhere.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my diligence I do not presume<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span> to offer this as
a work to which much might not be added. It has never happened that a
history, embracing so many objects, is at once produced perfect; though
it may gradually be rendered so. The history earliest in point of time,
becomes, in the end, the least in authority; and its greatest merit is
in having paved the way to more finished performances. Perfection is
still less to be expected in a compendium. The reader is here presented
with the names of many artists and authors; but many others might have
been admitted, whom want of leisure or opportunity, but not of respect,
has obliged us to omit. Here he will find a variety of opinions; but to
these many others might have been added. There is no man, of whom all
think alike. Baillet, just before mentioned, is a proof of this, with
regard to writers on literary subjects; and he who thinks the task
worthy of his pains might demonstrate it much more fully with respect to
different painters. Each judges by principles peculiar to himself:
Bonarruoti stigmatized as drivelling, Pietro Perugino and Francia, both
luminaries of the art; Guido, if we may credit history, was disapproved
of by Cortona; Caravaggio by Zucchero; Guercino by Guido; and, what
seems more extraordinary, Domenichino by most of the artists who
flourished at Rome, when he painted his finest pictures.<a
name="fnanchor_20" id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Had these artists written of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg
xxxv]</a></span>their rivals they either would have condemned them, or
spoken less favourably of them than unprejudiced individuals. Hence it
is that connoisseurs will frequently be found to approach nearer the
truth, in forming their estimate, than artists; the former adopt the
impartial feelings of the public, while the latter allow themselves to
be influenced by motives of envy or of prejudice. Innumerable similar
disputes are still maintained concerning several artists, who, like
different kinds of aliment, are found to be disagreeable or grateful to
different palates. To hold the happy mean, exempted from all party
spirit, is as impossible as to reconcile the opinions of mankind, which
are as multifarious as are the individuals of the species.</p>

<p>Amid such discrepancy of opinion I have judged it expedient to avoid
the most controverted points; in others, to subscribe to the decision of
the majority; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi"
id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>to allow to each his particular
opinion;<a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a
href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> but not, if possible, to
disappoint the reader, desirous of learning what is most authentic and
generally received. Ancient writers appear to have pursued this plan
when treating of the professors of any art, in which they themselves
were mere amateurs; nor could it arise from any other circumstance that
Cicero, Pliny, and Quintilian, express themselves upon the Greek artists
in the same manner. Their opinions coincide, because<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg
xxxvii]</a></span> that of the public was unanimous. I am aware that it
is difficult to obtain the opinion of the public concerning the more
modern artists, but it is not difficult with regard to those on whom
much has been already written. I am also aware that public opinion
accords not at all times with truth, because "it often happens to
incline to the wrong side of the question." This, however, is a rare
occurrence in the fine arts,<a name="fnanchor_22"
id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
nor does it militate against an historian who aims more at fidelity of
narrative, and impartiality of public opinion, than the discussion of
the relative merit or correctness of tastes.</p>

<p>My work is divided into six volumes; and I commence by treating in
the two first volumes of that part of Italy, which, through the genius
of Da Vinci, Michelangiolo, and Raffaello, became first conspicuous, and
first exhibited a decided character in painting. Those artists were the
ornaments of the Florentine and Roman schools, from which I proceed to
two others, the Sienese and Neapolitan. About the same time Giorgione,
Tiziano, and Coreggio, began to flourish in Italy; three artists, who as
much advanced the art of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii"
id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>colouring, as the former
improved design; and of these luminaries of Upper Italy I treat in the
third and fourth volumes; since the number of the names of artists, and
the many additions to this new impression, have induced me to devote two
volumes to their merits. Then follows the school of Bologna, in which
the attempt was made to unite the excellences of all the other schools:
this commences the fifth volume; and on account of proximity it is
succeeded by that of Ferrara, and Upper and Lower Romagna. The school of
Genoa, which was late in acquiring celebrity, succeeds, and we conclude
with that of Piedmont, which, though it cannot boast so long a
succession of artists as those of the other states, has merits
sufficient to entitle it to a place in a history of painting. Thus the
five most celebrated schools will be treated of in the order in which
they arose; in like manner as the ancient writers on painting began with
the Asiatic school, which was followed by the Grecian, and this last was
subdivided into the Attic and Sicyonian; to which in process of time
succeeded the Roman school.<a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a
href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The sixth and last volume
contains an ample index to the whole, quite indispensable to render the
work more extensively useful, and to give it its<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span> full advantage.
In assigning artists to any school I have paid more regard to other
circumstances than the place of their nativity; to their education,
their style, their place of residence in particular, and the instruction
of their pupils: circumstances, indeed, which are sometimes found so
blended and confused, that several cities may contend for one painter,
as they are said to have done for Homer. In such cases I do not pretend
to decide; the object of my labours being only to trace the vicissitudes
of the art in various places, and to point out those artists who have
exercised an influence over them; not to determine disputes, unpleasant
in themselves, and wholly foreign to my undertaking.</p>

For this fault, which the Greeks used to call <i>Acribia</i>, Pascoli
has been sharply reproved. He has, in fact, informed us which among the
several artists could boast a becoming and proportionate nose, which had
it short or long, aquiline or snubbed, very sharp or very hollow. He
most generally observes that such an artist was neither tall nor large
of stature, neither handsome nor plain in his physiognomy; and who would
have thought it worth his while to inquire about it? The sole utility
that can possibly attend such inquiries is, the chance of detecting some
impostor, who might attempt to palm upon us for a genuine portrait the
likeness of some other individual. Engravings, however, are the best
security against similar impositions.</p>

In the Magasin Encyclopédique of Paris, (An. viii. tom. iv. p. 63),
there is a work in two volumes, edited in the German language at
Gottingen, announced as well as commended. The first volume is dated
1798, the second 1801, from the pen of note the learned Sig. Florillo,
the title of which we insert in the second index. It consists of a
history of painting upon the plan of the present one; but there is some
variation in the order of the schools.</p>

It was finished in the year 1796, and it is now given, with various
additions and corrections throughout. Many churches, galleries, and
pictures, are here mentioned which are no longer in existence; but this
does not interfere with its truth, inasmuch as the title of the work is
confined to the before<ins title="hyphenated in the original">
</ins>mentioned year. Numerous friends have lent me their assistance in
the completion of this edition, and in particular the cavalier Gio. de'
Lazara, a gentleman of Padua, who possesses a rich collection, both in
books and MSS., and displays the utmost liberality in affording others
the use of them. To this merit, in regard to the present work, he has
likewise added that of revising and correcting it through the press, a
favour which I could not have more highly estimated from any other hand,
deeply versed as he is in the history of the fine arts.</p>

A learned Venetian, skilled in the practice of design and of painting.
He must not be confounded with Antonio Maria Zanetti, an eminent
engraver, who revived the art of taking prints from wooden blocks with
more than one colour, which was invented by Ugo da Carpi, but afterwards
lost. He also wrote works, serviceable to the fine arts; and several of
his letters may be seen in the second volume of <i>Lettere
Pittoriche</i>. They are subscribed <i>Antonio Maria Zanetti, q.
Erasmo</i>; but this is an error of the editor: it ought to be <i>q.
Girolamo</i>, to distinguish him from the other, who was called <i>del
q. Alessandro</i>. This mistake was detected by the accurate Vianelli,
in his Diario della Carriera, p. 49.</p>

An amateur, who happens to be unacquainted with the fact, that there
were various artists of the same name, as the Vecelli, Bassani, and
Caracci, will never become properly acquainted with these families of
painters; neither will he be competent to judge of certain pictures,
which only attract the regard of the vulgar, because they truly boast
the reputation of a great name.</p>

I do not admit this principle. Horace laid it down for the art of poetry
alone, because it is a faculty that perishes when it ceases to give
delight. Architecture, on the other hand, confers vast utility when it
does not please, by presenting us with habitations; and painting, and
sculpture, by preserving the features of men, and illustrious actions.
Besides, let us recollect, that Horace denounces the production of
inferior verses, because there is not space enough for them; "Non
concessere columnæ," but it is not so with paintings of mediocrity. In
any country Petrarch, Ariosto, and Tasso, may be read, and he who has
never read a poor poet, will write better than if he had read a hundred.
But it is not every one who can boast either in the houses or temples of
his country, of possessing the works of good artists; and for purposes
of worship or of ornament, the less excellent ones may suffice;
wherefore these also produce some advantage.</p>

For the improvement of my latest edition, I am greatly indebted to the
Prince Filippo Ercolani, who, having purchased from the heirs of Signor
Marcello Oretti fifty-two manuscript volumes, which that indefatigable
amateur, in the course of his studies, journeys, and observations, had
compiled respecting the professors of the fine arts, their eras, and
their labours, allowed materials to be drawn from them for various
notes, by the Sig. Lazara, who superintended the edition. To the devoted
attachment of these gentlemen to the fine arts, the public are indebted
for much information, either wholly new, or hitherto little known.</p>

Vasari, from whom several epochs are taken, is full of errors in dates,
as may be every where perceived. See Bottari's note on tom. ii. p. 79.
The same observation applies generally to other authors, as Bottari
remarks in a note on <i>Lettere Pittoriche</i>, tom. iv. p. 366. A
similar objection is made to the Dictionary of P. Orlandi in another
letter, tom. ii. p. 318, where it is termed "a useful work, but so full
of errors, that one can derive no benefit from it without possessing the
books there quoted." After three editions of this work, a fourth was
printed in Venice, in 1753, corrected and enlarged by Guarienti, "but
enough still remains to be done after his additions, even to increase it
twofold." Bottari, Lett. Pitt. tom. iii. p. 353. See also Crespi <i>Vite
de' Pittori Bolognesi</i>, p. 50. No one, who has not perused this book,
would believe how often he defaces Orlandi in presuming to correct him;
multiplying artists for every little difference with which authors wrote
the name of the same man. Thus Pier Antonio Torre, and Antonio Torri,
are with him two different men. Many of the articles, however, added by
him, relating to artists unknown to P. Orlandi, are useful; so that this
second Dictionary ought to be consulted with caution, not altogether
rejected. The last edition, printed at Florence, in two volumes,
contains the names of many painters, either lately dead, or still
living, and often of very inferior merit, and on this account is little
noticed in my history. This Dictionary, moreover, affords little
satisfaction to the reader concerning the old masters, unless he possess
a work printed at Florence in twelve volumes, entitled <i>Serie degli
Uomini più illustri in Pittura</i>, to which the articles in it often
refer. The Dizionario Portatile, by Mr. La Combe, is also a book of
reference, not very valuable to those who look for exact information. We
give a single instance of his inaccuracy in regard to the elder Palma;
but our emendations have been chiefly directed towards the writers of
Italy, from whom foreigners have, or ought to have borrowed, in writing
respecting our artists.</p>

"Some made use of pure colours, without blending one with the other; a
practice well understood in the age of Titiano: others, as Coreggio,
adopted a method totally opposite: he laid on his admirable colours in
such a manner, that they appear as if they had been breathed without
effort on the canvas; so soft and so clear, without harshness of
outline, and so relieved, that he seems the rival of nature. The elder
Palma and Lorenzo Lotto coloured freshly, and finished their pictures as
highly as Giovanni Bellini; but they have loaded and overwhelmed them
with outline and softness in the style of Titiano and Giorgione. Some
others, as Tintoretto, to a purity of colour not inferior to the artists
above<ins title="hyphenated in the original"> </ins>mentioned, have
added a boldness as grand as it is astonishing;" &amp;c. Baldinucci,

We must recollect that "de pictore, sculptore, fusore, judicare nisi
artifex non potest," (Plin. Jun. i. epist. 10); which must be understood
of certain refinements of the art that may escape the eye of the most
learned connoisseur. But have we any need of a painter to whisper in our
ear whether the features of a figure are handsome or ugly, its colouring
false or natural, whether it has harmony and expression, or whether its
composition be in the Roman or Venetian taste? And where it is really
expedient to have the opinion of an artist, which we therefore report as
we have either read it or heard it, will that opinion have less
authority in my pages than on his own tongue?</p>

Abundance of quotations, and descriptions of the minutest particulars
from rarer works is a characteristic of the present day, to which I
think I have sufficiently conformed in my second Index. But in a history
expressly composed to instruct and please, I have judged it right not to
interrupt the thread of the narrative too frequently with different
authorities. The works from which I draw my account of each artist are
indicated in the body of the history and in the first index: to make
continual allusion to them might please a few, but would prove very
disagreeable to many.</p>

Pietro da Cortona told Falconieri that when the celebrated picture of S.
Girolamo della Carità was exhibited, "it was so abused by all the
eminent painters, of whom many then flourished, that he himself joined
in its condemnation, in order to save his credit." See Falconieri, Lett.
Pittor. tom. ii. lett. 17. He continues: "Is not the tribune of the
church of S. Andrea della Valle, ornamented by Domenichino, among the
finest specimens of painting in fresco? and yet they talked of sending
masons with hammers to knock it down after he had displayed it. When
Domenichino afterwards passed through the church, he stopped with his
scholars to view it; and, shrugging up his shoulders, observed, 'After
all, I do not think the picture so badly executed.'"</p>

The most singular and novel opinions concerning our painters are
contained in the volumes published by M. Cochin, who is confuted in the
<i>Guides</i> to the cities of Padua and Parma, and is often convicted
of erroneous statements in matter of fact. He is reproved, with regard
to Bologna, by Crespi, in Lett. Pittor. tom. vii.; and for what he has
said of Genoa, by Ratti, in the lives of the painters of that city.
Commencing with his preface, they point out the grossest errors in
Cochin. It is there also observed that his work was disapproved of by
Watellet, by Clerisseau, and other French connoisseurs then living: nor
do I believe it would have pleased Filibien, De Piles, and such masters
of the critical art. Italy also, at a later period, has produced a book,
which aims at overturning the received opinions on subjects connected
with the fine arts. It is entitled <i>Arte di vedere secondo i principii
di Sulzer e di Mengs</i>. The author, who in certain periodical works at
Rome, was called the modern Diogenes, has been honoured with various
confutations. (See <i>Lettera in Difesa del Cav. Ratti</i>, p. 11.)
Authors like these launch their extravagant opinions, for the purpose of
attracting the gaze of the world; but men of letters, if they cannot
pass them over in silence, ought not to be very anxious to gratify their
wishes&mdash;"Opinionum commenta delet dies." <i>Cicero.</i></p>

<a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></h4>

<p class="p2">Luigi Lanzi was born in the year 1732, at Monte dell'
Olmo, in the diocese of Fermo, of an ancient family, which is said to
have enjoyed some of the chief honours of the municipality to which it
belonged. His father was a physician, and also a man of letters: his
mother, a truly excellent and pious woman, was allied to the family of
the Firmani. How deeply sensible the subject of this memoir was of the
advantages he derived, in common with many illustrious characters, from
early maternal precepts and direction, he has shewn in a beautiful Latin
elegy to her memory, which appeared in his work, entitled
<i>Inscriptionum et Carminum</i>.</p>

<p>Possessed of a naturally lively and penetrating turn of mind, he
began early to investigate the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii"
id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>merits of the great writers of his
own country; alike in poetry, in history, and in art. His poetical taste
was formed on the models of Petrarch and of Dante, and he was
accustomed, while yet a child, to repeat their finest passages to his
father, an enthusiastic admirer of Italy's old poets, who took pride in
cultivating the same fervour in the mind of his son, a fervour of which
in more northern climates, we can form little idea. His imitations of
these early poets, whose spirit he first imbibed at the fountain head,
before he grew familiar with the corrupt and tasteless compositions of
succeeding eras, are said to have frequently been so bold and striking,
as to deceive the paternal eye. To these, too, he was perhaps mainly
indebted for that energy of feeling, and solidity of judgment, as well
as that richness of illustration and allusion, which confer attractions
upon his most serious and elaborate works. He was no less intimate with
the best political and literary historians at an early age; with
Machiavelli, Davila, and Guicciardini; with Muratori and Tiraboschi;
whose respective compositions he was destined to rival in the world of
art.</p>

<p>Lanzi's first studies were pursued in the Jesuits' College at Fermo,
where an Italian Canzone, written in praise of the Beata Vergine, is
said to have acquired for him, as a youth of great promise, the highest
degree of regard. Under the care of his spiritual instructor, father
Raimondo Cunich, Lanzi likewise became deeply versed in all the
excellences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii"
id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span> of classical literature, not as a
vain parade of words and syllables; for along with the technical skill
of the scholar, he imbibed the spirit of the ancient writers. In his
succeeding philosophical and mathematical studies he was assisted by
Father Boscovich, one of the first mathematicians of his day. Thus to a
keen and fertile intellect, animated by enthusiasm for true poetry and
the beauties of art, was added that regular classical and scientific
learning, inducing a love of order and of truth, capable of applying the
clear logic derived from Euclid to advantage, in subjects of a less
tangible and demonstrative nature. The value of such preliminary
acquirements to the examination of antiquarian and scientific remains,
which can only be conducted on uncertain data and a calculation of
possibilities, as in ancient specimens of art, can bear no question; and
of this truth Lanzi was fully aware. To feel rightly, to reason clearly,
to decide upon probabilities, to distinguish degrees, resemblances, and
differences, comparing and weighing the whole with persevering accuracy;
these were among the essentials which Lanzi conceived requisite to
prepare a writer upon works of art.</p>

<p>These qualities, too, will be found finely relieved and elevated by
frequent and appropriate passages of eloquent feeling; flowing from that
sincere veneration for his subject, and that love which may be termed
the religion of the art to which he became so early attached. How
intimately <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg
xliv]</a></span>such a spirit is connected with the best triumphs of the
art of painting, is seen in the angelic faces of Da Vinci, of Raffaello,
and Coreggio; and the same enthusiasm must have been felt by a true
critic, such as Lanzi. Far, however, from impeding him in the
acquisition of his stores of antiquarian knowledge, and in his
scientific arrangements, his enthusiasm conferred upon him only an
incredible degree of diligence and despatch. He was at once enabled to
decipher the age and character, to arrange in its proper class, and to
give the most exact description of every object of art which passed
under his review.</p>

<p>Lanzi thus came admirably prepared to his great task, one of the most
complete models of sound historical composition, of which the modern age
can boast. It was written in the full maturity of his powers; no hasty
or isolated undertaking, it followed a series of other excellent
treatises, all connected with some branches of the subject, and
furnishing materials for his grand design. Circumstances further
contributed to promote his views. Shortly after the dissolution of the
order of Jesuits, to which he belonged, he was recommended by his friend
Fabroni, prior of the church of S. Lorenzo, to the grand duke Leopold of
Florence, who, in 1775, appointed him to the care of his cabinet of
medals and gems, in the gallery of Florence. This gave rise to one of
his first publications, entitled, <i>A Description of the Florentine
Gallery</i>, which he sent in 1782 to the same friend,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
Angiolo Fabroni, then General Provveditore of the Studio at Pisa, and
who conducted the celebrated Literary Journal of that place, in which
Lanzi's <span class="smcap">Description</span> appeared.</p>

<p>His next dissertation, still more enriched with antiquarian
illustration and research, was his Essay on the <i>Ancient Italian
dialects</i>, which contains a curious account of old Etruscan
monuments, and the ducal collection of classical vases and urns. This
was followed by his <i>Preliminary Notices respecting the Sculpture of
the Ancients, and their various Styles</i>, put forth in the year 1789,
in which he pursues the same plan which he subsequently perfected in the
history before us, of allotting to each style its respective epochs, to
each epoch its peculiar characters, these last being exemplified by
their leading professors, most celebrated in history. He farther adduces
examples of his system as he proceeds, from the various cabinets of the
Royal Museum, which he explains to the reader as a part of his chief
design in illustrating them. He enters largely into the origin and
character of the Etruscan School, and examines very fully the
criticisms, both on ancient and Italian art, by <ins title="'Winckelman'
in the original.">Winckelmann</ins> and Mengs.</p>

<p>From the period of these publications, the Grand Duke, entertaining a
high opinion of Lanzi's judgment, was in the habit of consulting him
before he ventured to add any new specimens to his cabinet of
antiquities. He was also entrusted with a fresh arrangement of some new
cabinets belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi"
id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span> to the gallery, which together with
the latter, he finally completed, on a system which it is said never
fails to awaken the admiration of all scientific visitors at Florence.
During this task, his attention had been particularly directed to the
interpretation of the monuments and Etruscan inscriptions contained in
the ducal gallery, which, together with the ancient Tuscan, the Umbrian,
and other obsolete dialects, soon grew familiar to him, and led to the
composition of his celebrated <i>Essay upon the Tuscan Tongue</i>. For
the purpose of more complete research and illustration, he obtained
permission from the duke to visit Rome, in order to consult the museums,
and prepare the way for his essay, which he published there in 1789; a
work of immense erudition and research.</p>

<p>It was here Lanzi first appeared as the most profound antiquarian of
modern Italy, by his successful explanation of some ancient Etruscan
inscriptions and remains of art, which had baffled the skill of a number
of his most distinguished countrymen. Upon presenting it to the grand
duke, after his return from Rome, Lanzi was immediately appointed his
head antiquary and director of the Florentine gallery; while the city of
Gubbio raised him to the rank of their first patrician order, on account
of his successful elucidation of the famous Eugubine Tables. In one of
his <i>Dissertations upon a small Tuscan Urn</i>, he triumphantly
refuted some charges which had been invidiously advanced against him,
and defended his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii"
id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span> principles of antiquarian
illustration by retorting the charge of fallacy upon his
adversaries.</p>

<p>In the year <ins title="1720 in the original">1790</ins>, Lanzi, at
the request of the Gonfaloniere and priors of Monte dell'Olino,
published an inquiry into the <i>Condition and Site of Pausula, an
ancient City of Piceno</i>; said to be written with surprising
ingenuity, yet with equal fairness; uninfluenced by any prejudices
arising from national partiality, or from the nature of the commission
with which he had been honoured. This was speedily followed by a much
more important undertaking, connected with the prosecution of his great
design, which it would appear he had already for some time
entertained.</p>

<p>During the period of his travels through Italy in pursuit of
antiquities, he had carefully collected materials for a general History
of Painting, which was meant to comprize, in a compendious form,
whatever should be found scattered throughout the numerous authors who
had written upon the art. These materials, as well as the work itself,
had gradually grown upon his hands, as might be expected from a man so
long accustomed to method, to criticism, to perspicuity; in short, to
every quality requisite in the philosophical treatment of a great
subject. The artists and literati of Italy, then, were not a little
surprised at the appearance of the first portion of the <i>Storia

genuine feeling, and with true, not imaginary, commendations."
<i>Elogio</i>, p. 127.</p>

<p>But the unfeigned pleasure and admiration expressed in the world of
literature and art, on being presented with the Pictorial History of
Lower Italy, was almost equalled by its disappointment at the delay
experienced with regard to the appearance of the second part; and which
it was feared would never see the light. Lanzi's state of health had,
some time subsequent to 1790, been very precarious; and he suffered
severely from a distressing complaint,<a name="fnanchor_25"
id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
which frequently interrupted his travels in which he was then engaged,
collecting further materials for his History of Painting in Upper Italy.
While thus employed, on his return from Genoa in December, 1793, he
experienced a first attack of apoplexy, as he was passing the mountains
of Massa and Carrara. After his recovery, and return to Florence, he was
advised in the ensuing spring to visit the baths of Albano, which being
situated near Bassano, afforded him an opportunity of superintending the
publication of his history, in the Remondini <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>Press, and on a more
extensive scale than he had at first contemplated. He likewise obtained
permission from the grand duke Leopold to absent himself, during some
time, from his charge at Florence, in September, 1793. The first portion
of his labours he conceived to be too scanty in point of names and
notices to satisfy public taste, so that upon completing the latter part
upon a more full and extensive scale, he gave a new edition of that
already published, very considerably altered and augmented.</p>

<p>To these improvements he invariably contributed, both in notes and
text, at every subsequent edition, a number of which appeared in the
course of a few years, until the work attained a degree of completeness
and correctness seldom bestowed upon labours of such incredible
difficulty and extent. The last which received the correction and
additions of the author was published at Bassano, in the year 1809.</p>

<p>That a work upon such a scale was a great desideratum, no less to
Italy than to the general world of art, would appear evident from the
character of the various histories and accounts of painting which had
preceded it. They are rather valuable as records, than as real criticism
or history; as annals of particular characters and productions derived
from contemporary observation, than as sound and enlightened views, and
a dispassionate estimate of individual merits. Full of errors, idle
prejudices, and discussions foreign to the subject, a <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>large
portion of their pages is taken up in vapid conceits, personal
accusations, and puerile reasoning, destitute of method.</p>

<p>The work of Lanzi, on the other hand, as it is well remarked by the
Cav. Boni, observes throughout the precept of the <i>serie et
junctura</i> of Horace. It brings into full light the leading professors
of the art, exhibits at due distance those of the second class, and only
glances at mediocrity and inferiority of character, insomuch as to fill
up the great pictoric canvas with its just lights and shades. The true
causes of the decline and revival of the art at certain epochs are
pointed out, with those that contribute to preserve the fine arts in
their happiest lustre; in which, recourse to examples more than to
precepts is strongly recommended. The best rules are unfolded for
facilitating the study of different manners, some of which are known to
bear a resemblance, though by different hands, and others are opposed to
each other, although adopted by the same artist; a species of knowledge
highly useful at a period when the best productions are eagerly sought
after at a high rate. It is a history, in short, worthy of being placed
at the side of that on the Literature of Italy by Tiraboschi, who having
touched upon the fine arts at the outset of his labours, often urged his
ancient friend and colleague to dilate upon a subject in every way so
flattering to the genius of Italy; to Italy which, however rivalled by
other nations in science and in literature, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span>stands triumphant and
alone in its creative mind of art.</p>

<p>It is, however, difficult to convey a just idea of a work composed
upon so enlarged and complete a scale; which embraces a period of about
six centuries, and fourteen Italian schools, but treated with such
rapidity and precision, as to form in itself a compendium of whatever we
meet with in so many volumes of guides, catalogues, descriptions of
churches and palaces, and in so many lives of artists throughout the
whole of Italy. (pp. 130-1.)</p>

<p>It is known that Richardson expressed a wish that some historian
would collect these scattered accounts relating to the art of painting,
at the same time noting down its progress and decline in every age, a
desideratum which Mengs in part supplied in one of his letters, briefly
marking down all the respective eras. Upon this plan, as far as regarded
Venetian painting, Zanetti had partially proceeded; but the general
survey, in its perfect form, of the whole of the other schools, was
destined to be completed by the genius of Lanzi. Here he first gives the
general character of each, distinguishing its particular epochs,
according to the alterations in taste which it underwent. A few artists
of distinguished reputation, whose influence gave a new impulse and new
laws to the art, stand at the head of each era, which they may be said
to have produced, with a full description of their style. To these great
masters, their respective pupils are annexed, with the progress of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg
lii]</a></span>school, referring to such as may have more or less added
to, or altered the manner of their prototype. For the sake of greater
perspicuity, the painters of history are kept distinct from the artists
in inferior branches; among whom are classed portrait and landscape
painters, those of animals, of flowers, of fruits, &amp;c. Nor are such
as bear an affinity to the art, like engraving, inlaying, mosaic work,
and embroidery, wholly excluded. Being doubtful whether he should make
mention of those artists who belong neither to the senatorial, the
equestrian, nor the popular order of the pictorial republic, and have no
public representation, such as the names of mediocrity; Lanzi finally
decided to introduce them among their superiors, like third-rate actors,
whose figures may just be seen, in order to preserve the entireness of
the story. To this he was farther induced by the general appearance of
their names in the various dictionaries, guides, and descriptions of
cities and of galleries; and by the example of Homer, Cicero, and most
great writers; Homer himself commemorating, along with the wise and
brave also the less valiant&mdash;the fools and the cowards.
(<i>Elogio</i>, pp. 129, 130, 131.)</p>

<p>After having resided during a considerable period at Bassano,
occupied in the superintendence of the first edition of his great work,
Lanzi found himself compelled to retire to Udine, in 1796, from the more
immediate scene of war; a war which subsequently involved other cities
of Italy <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg
liii]</a></span>in its career. From Udine he shortly returned to
Florence, where he again resumed his former avocations in the ducal
gallery, about the period of the commencement of the Bourbon
government.</p>

<p>Lanzi's next literary undertaking was three Dissertations upon
<i>Ancient painted Vases, commonly called Etruscan</i>; and he
subsequently published a very excellent and pleasing work, entitled,
<i>Aloisii Lanzii Inscriptionum et Carminum Libri Tres</i>: works which
obtained for him the favourable notice of the Bourbon court. Nor was he
less distinguished by that of the new French dynasty, which shortly
obtained the ascendancy throughout all Italy, as well as at Florence,
and by which Lanzi was appointed President of the Cruscan Academy.</p>

<p>Among Lanzi's latest productions may be classed his edition and
translations of Hesiod; entitled <i>I Lavori, e le Giornate di Esiodo
Ascreo opera con L. Codici riscontrata, emendata la versione latina,
aggiuntavi l'Italiana in Terze Rime con annotazioni</i>. In this he had
been engaged as far back as the year 1785, and it had been then
announced in a beautiful edition of Hesiod, translated into Latin by
Count Zamagua.</p>

<p>The list will here close with his <i>Opere Sacre</i>, sacred
treatises, produced on a variety of occasions, and on a variety of
spiritual subjects. One of these was upon the Holy Sacrament, entitled,
<i>Il divoto del SS. Sacramento istruito nella pratica</i> <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg
liv]</a></span><i>di tal devozione</i>. In truth, Lanzi was a good <ins
title="not capitalized in the original">Christian</ins>, and may be
ranked in the number of that great and honoured band of Christian
philosophers, who like Newton, Locke, and Paley, have triumphantly
opposed the whole strength of their mighty intellect, and vast reach of
their reasoning powers to the specious and witty, but less powerful and
argumentative genius of Gibbon, of Hume, and of Voltaire. Nor was the
conviction of these great truths in the mind of Lanzi the result of
sickness and misfortunes, or sombre reflections in the decline of life.
Great as was the reputation he had acquired by his valuable labours, he
was often known sincerely to declare, among his private friends, that he
would willingly renounce all kind of literary honours for the pleasure
of being assured, that his sacred works had in any degree promoted the
cause of Christianity.</p>

<p>Shortly after the last edition of the History now before us, which he
had personally superintended, though at a very advanced age, in the year
1809, at Bassano, Lanzi's health began rapidly to decline, and he
prepared with perfect composure to meet the termination of his earthly
career. He had already attained his seventy-eighth year; but his mind
preserved its usual tone and vigour, though he could with difficulty
pace his apartment. He wrote letters, and even pursued his beloved
studies on the day of his decease, which took place on Sunday, the 30th
of March, 1810, occasioned by a fresh attack of apoplexy. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>For
this he had long been prepared, and only the preceding evening had taken
an affectionate leave of his friends and domestics, thanking the Cav.
Boni for his kindness in continuing so long to mount his staircase to
visit an old man.</p>

It may be proper to observe, that the materials of the biographical
sketch here offered to the public, are extracted from an extremely
pleasing and popular tribute to the memory of Lanzi, of very general
repute in Italy, from the pen of his intimate friend and associate, the
Cavalier Bossi, himself a man of singular merit and acquirements, whose
<i>Elogio</i> upon his distinguished countryman has deservedly been
added to the recent editions of his invaluable history.</p>

<p class="p2">That there were painters in Italy, even during the rude
ages, is attested not only by historians,<a name="fnanchor_26"
id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
but by several pictures which have escaped the ravages of time; Rome
retains several ancient specimens.<a name="fnanchor_27"

Passing over her cemeteries, which have handed down to us a number of
Christian monuments, part in specimens of painted glass, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_002" id="Page_002">[Pg
2]</a></span>scattered through our museums, and part in those of
parietal histories, or walled mosaic, it will be sufficient to adduce
two vast works, unrivalled by any others, that I know of, in Italy. The
first is the series of the Popes, which in order to prove the succession
of the papal chair, from the prince of the Apostles down to the time of
St. Leo, this last holy pontiff caused to be painted; a work of the
fifth century, which was subsequently continued until our own times. The
second is the decoration of the whole church of San Urbano, where there
are several evangelical acts represented on the walls, along with some
histories of the Titular Saint and St. Cecilia, a production which,
partaking in nothing either of the Greek lineaments or style of drapery,
may be attributed more justly to an Italian pencil, which has subscribed
the date of 1011.<a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a
href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Many more might be pointed
out, existing in different cities; as for instance the picture at
Pesara, of the patron saints of the city, illustrated by the celebrated
Annibale Olivieri, which is earlier than the year 1000; those in the
vaults of the cathedral at Aquileja,<a name="fnanchor_29"
id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
the picture <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_003" id="Page_003">[Pg
3]</a></span>at Santa Maria Primerana at Fiesole, which seems the work
of that or the succeeding age;<a name="fnanchor_30"
id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
and the picture at Orvieto which was formerly known by the name of S.
Maria Prisca, but is now generally called S. Brizio.<a
name="fnanchor_31" id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a> I say nothing of the figures of the virgin
formerly ascribed to St. Luke, and now supposed to be the production of
the eleventh or twelfth century, as I shall have to treat of them at the
opening of the third book. The painters of those times were, however, of
little repute; they produced no illustrious scholars, no work worthy of
marking an era. The art had gradually degenerated into a kind of
mechanism, which, after the models afforded by the Greek workers in
mosaic employed in the church of St. Mark, at Venice,<a
name="fnanchor_32" id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a> invariably exhibited the same legends, in
which nature appeared distorted rather than represented. It was not till
after the middle of the thirteenth century that any thing better was
attempted; and the improvement of sculpture was the first step towards
the formation of a new style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_004" id="Page_004">[Pg
4]</a></span>The honour of this is due to the Tuscans; a nation that
from very remote antiquity disseminated the benign light of art and
learning throughout Italy; but it more especially belongs to the people
of Pisa. They taught artists how to shake off the trammels of the modern
Greeks, and to adopt the ancients for their models. Barbarism had not
only overwhelmed the arts, but even the maxims necessary for their
re-establishment. Italy was not destitute of fine specimens of Grecian
and Roman sculpture; but she had long been without an artist who could
appreciate their value, much less attempt to imitate them. Little else
was executed in those dark ages but some rude pieces of sculpture, such
as what remains in the cathedral of Modena, in San Donato at Arezzo, in
the Primaziale at Pisa,<a name="fnanchor_33" id="fnanchor_33"></a><a
href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and in some other churches
where specimens are preserved on the doors or in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_005" id="Page_005">[Pg 5]</a></span>the
interior. Niccola Pisano was the first who discovered and pursued the
true path. There were, and still are, some ancient sarcophagi in Pisa,
especially that which inclosed the body of Beatrice, mother of the
Countess Matilda, who died in the eleventh century. A chase, supposed to
represent that of Hippolytus, is sculptured on it in basso relievo,
which must be the production of a good school; being a subject which has
been often delineated by the ancients on many urns still extant at
Rome.<a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34"
class="fnanchor">[34]</a> This was the model which Niccola selected,
from this he formed a style which participated of the antique,
especially in the heads and the casting of the drapery; and when
exhibited in different Italian cities "it inspired artists with a
laudable emulation to apply to sculpture more assiduously than they had
before done," as we are informed by Vasari. Niccola did not attain to
what he aspired. The compositions are sometimes crowded, the figures are
often badly designed, and shew more diligence than expression. His name,
however, will always mark an era in the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_006" id="Page_006">[Pg 6]</a></span>history of design,
because he first led artists into the true path by the introduction of a
better standard. Reform in any branch of study invariably depends on
some rule, which, promulgated and adopted by the schools, gradually
produces a general revolution in opinion, and opens a new field to the
exertions of a succeeding age.</p>

<p>About 1231, he sculptured at Bologna the urn of San Domenico, and
from this, as a remarkable event, he was named "<i>Niccola of the
Urn</i>." He afterwards executed in a much superior style, the Last
Judgment, for the cathedral of Orvieto, and the pulpit in the church of
San Giovanni, at Pisa; works that demonstrate to the world that design,
invention, and composition, received from him a new existence. He was
succeeded by Arnolfo Florentino, his scholar, the sculptor of the tomb
of Boniface VIII. in San Pietro at Rome; and by his son Giovanni, who
executed the monuments of Urban IV. and of Benedict IX. in Perugia. He
afterwards completed the great altar of San Donato, at Arezzo, the cost
of which was thirty thousand gold florins; besides many other works
which remain in Naples and in several cities of Tuscany. Andrea Pisano
was his associate, and probably also his disciple in Perugia, who, after
establishing himself in Florence, ornamented with statues the cathedral
and the church of San Giovanni in that city; and in twenty-two years
finished the great gate of bronze "to which we are indebted for all that
is excellent, difficult, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_007"
id="Page_007">[Pg 7]</a></span>or beautiful in the other two, which are
the workmanship of succeeding artists." He was, in fact, the founder of
that great school that successively produced Orcagna, Donatello, and the
celebrated Ghiberti, who fabricated those gates for the same church,
which Michelagnolo pronounced worthy to form the entrance of Paradise.
After Andrea, we may notice Giovanni Balducci, of Pisa, whose era,
country, and style, all lead us to suppose him one of the same school.
He was an excellent artist, and was employed by Castruccio, Lord of
Lucca, and by Azzone Visconti, Prince of Milan; where he flourished, and
left, among other monuments of his art, the tomb of San Pietro Martire,
at S. Eustorgio, which is so highly praised by Torre, by Lattuada, and
by various other learned illustrators of Milanese antiquities.<a
name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35"
class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Two eminent artists, natives of Siena,
proceeded from the school of Gio. Pisano, namely, the two brothers,
Agnolo and Agostino, who are greatly commended by Vasari as improvers of
the art. Whoever has seen the sepulchre of Guido, bishop of Arezzo,
which is decorated with an infinity of statues and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_008" id="Page_008">[Pg 8]</a></span><ins
title="not hyphenated in the original">basso-relievos</ins>,
representing passages of his life, will not only find reason to admire
in them the design, which was the work of Giotto, but the execution of
the sculpture. The brothers also executed many of their own designs in
Orvieto, in Siena, and in Lombardy, where they brought up several
pupils, who for a long period pursued their manner, and diffused it over
Italy.</p>

<p>To the improvement of sculpture succeeded that of mosaic, through the
efforts of another Tuscan, belonging to the order of minor friars, named
Fra Jacopo, or Fra Mino da Turrita, from a place in the territory of
Siena. It is not known whether he was instructed in his art by the
Romans or by the Greek workers in mosaic,<a name="fnanchor_36"
id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
but it is well ascertained that he very far surpassed them. On examining
what remains of his works in Santa Maria Maggiore at Rome, one can
hardly be persuaded that it is the production of so rude an age, did not
history constrain us to believe it. It appears probable that he took the
ancients for his models, and deduced his rules from the more chaste
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_009" id="Page_009">[Pg
9]</a></span>specimens of mosaic, still remaining in several of the
Roman churches, the design of which is less crude, the attitudes less
forced, and the composition more skilful, than were exhibited by the
Greeks who ornamented the church of San Marco, at Venice. Mino surpassed
them in every thing. From 1225, when he executed, however feebly, the
mosaic of the tribune of the church of San Giovanni, at Florence, he was
considered at the head of the living artists in mosaic.<a
name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37"
class="fnanchor">[37]</a> He merited this praise much more by his works
at Rome, and it appears that he long maintained his reputation. Vasari
has not been sufficiently just to the fame of Turrita, in noticing him
only casually in the life of Tafi, but the verses he recites, and the
commissions he mentions, demonstrate how greatly Turrita was esteemed by
his contemporaries. It is maintained that he was also a painter, but
this is a mistake which will be cleared up in the Sienese school, and
both there and elsewhere I shall question the authority of any author
who either greatly commends or underrates him.</p>

<p>From a deficiency of <i>specimens</i>, like those above recorded,
painting long remained in a more rude state than mosaic, and was very
far behind sculpture. But we must not imagine, that at the birth of
Cimabue, in 1240, the race of artists was entirely extinct, as
erroneously asserted by Vasari: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_010"
id="Page_010">[Pg 10]</a></span>this must be deemed an exaggeration, for
he himself has recounted several sculptors, architects, and painters
then living; and the general scope of his less cautious expressions,
against which so many writers have inveighed, and still continue to
declaim, favours this opinion. I shall be constrained to advert, in
almost every book, to their accusations, and to produce the names of the
artists who then lived. I shall commence with those who then flourished
in Tuscany. The city of Pisa, at this time, had not only painters, but a
school for each of the fine arts<a name="fnanchor_38"
id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.
The distinguished Signor Morrona, who has illustrated the Pisan
antiquities, deduces its origin immediately from Greece. The Pisans,
already very powerful by sea and land, having resolved in 1063 to erect
the vast fabric of their cathedral, had drawn thither artists in
miniature, and other painters, at the same time with Buschetto the
architect, and these men educated pupils for the city. The Greeks at
that time were but ill qualified to instruct, for they knew little.
Their first pupils in Pisa seem to have been a few anonymous artists,
some of whose miniatures and rude paintings are still in existence. A
parchment, containing the <i>exultet</i>, as usually sung on Sabbato
Santo, is in the cathedral, and we may here and there observe, painted
on it, figures in miniature, with plants and animals: it is a relique of
the early part of the twelfth century, yet a specimen of art not
altogether barbarous. There are likewise some <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_011" id="Page_011">[Pg 11]</a></span>other paintings of that
century in the same cathedral, containing figures of our Lady, with the
holy infant on her right arm: they are rude, but the progress of the
same school may be traced from them to the time of Giunta. This artist
lately received a fine eulogium, among other illustrious Pisans, from
Signor Tempesta, and he was fully entitled to it from the more early
historians. His country possesses none of his undoubted pictures, except
a crucifixion with his name, which is believed to be among his earliest
productions, a print from which may be found in the third volume of
<i>Pisa Illustrata</i>. He executed better pictures in Assisi, where he
was invited to paint by Frat' Elia di Cortona, superior of the Minori,
about the year 1230. From thence we are furnished with notices of his
education, which is thus described by P. Angeli, the Historian of that
cathedral: "Juncta Pisanus ruditer à Græcis instructus, primus ex
Italis, artem apprehendit circa An. Sal. 1210." In the church of the
Angioli there is a better preserved work of the same master; it is a
crucifixion, painted on a wooden cross; on the lateral edges and upper
surface of which our Lady is represented, with two other half-length
figures, and underneath the remains of an inscription are legible, which
having copied on the spot, I do not hesitate to publish with its
deficiencies now supplied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012">[Pg

asserts,<a name="fnanchor_39" id="fnanchor_39"></a><a
href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> that about this time, a
<i>Giunta da Giuntino</i> is mentioned in the records of Pisa, whom by
the aid of the <i>Assisi</i> inscription, I conjecture to be the painter
we have now under notice. The figures are considerably less than life;
the design is dry, the fingers excessively long, but these are <i>vitia
non hominum sed temporum</i>; in short, this piece shews a knowledge of
the naked figure, an expression of pain in the heads, and a disposition
of the drapery, greatly superior to the efforts of the Greeks, his
contemporaries. The handling of his colours is strong, although the
flesh inclines to that of bronze; the local tints are judiciously
varied, the chiaroscuro even shews some art, and the whole is not
inferior, except in the proportions, to crucifixions with similar half
figures usually ascribed to Cimabue. He painted at Assisi another
crucifixion, which is now lost, to which may be added, a portrait of
Frat' Elia, with this inscription, "<i>F. Helias fecit fieri. Jesu
Christe pie miserere precantis Heliæ. Juncta Pisanus me pinxit, An. D.
1236. Indit. IX.</i>" The inscription has been preserved by P. Wadingo
in his annals of the Franciscan order for that year, and the historian
describes the crucifixion as <i>affabre pictum</i>. The fresco works of
Giunta were executed in the great church of the Franciscans, and
according to Vasari he was there assisted by certain<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_013" id="Page_013">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Greeks. Some busts and history pieces still remain in the gallery and
the contiguous chapels, among which is the crucifixion of San Pietro,
noticed in the <i>Etruria Pittrice</i>. Some believe that those
paintings have been here and there injudiciously retouched, and this may
serve to excuse the drawing, which may have been altered in many places,
but the feebleness of the colouring cannot be denied. When they are
compared with what Cimabue executed there about forty years afterwards,
it seems that Giunta was not sufficiently forcible in this species of
painting; perhaps he might have improved, but he is not mentioned after
1235; and it is conjectured that he died while yet a young man, at a
distance from his native country. I am induced to believe so from
observing, that Giunta di Giuntino is noticed in the records of Pisa, in
the early part of that century, but not afterwards; and that Cimabue was
sent for to paint the altar-piece and portrait of San Francesco of Pisa,
about the year 1265, before he went to Assisi. It is more likely that
Giunta would have executed this, had he returned home from that city,
where he had seen and perhaps painted the portrait of the Holy Father.<a

class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_014" id="Page_014">[Pg
14]</a></span>From this school the art is believed to have spread in
these early times over all Tuscany, although it must not be forgotten
that there were miniature painters there as well as in the other parts
of Italy, who, transferring their art from small to large works, like
Franco of Bologna, betook themselves, and incited others to painting on
walls and on panel. Whatever we may choose to believe, Siena, at this
period, could boast her Guido, who painted from the year 1221, but not
entirely in the manner of the Greeks, as we shall find under the Sienese
school. Lucca possessed in 1235 one Bonaventura Berlingieri. A San
Francesco painted by him still exists in the castle of Guiglia, not far
from Modena, which is described as a work of great merit for that age.<a
name="fnanchor_41" id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41"
class="fnanchor">[41]</a> There lived another artist about the year
1288, known by his production of a crucifixion which he left at San
Cerbone, a short distance from the city with this inscription;
"<i>Deodatus filius Orlandi de Luca me pinxit</i>, A. D. 1288."
Margaritone of Arezzo was a disciple and imitator of the Greeks, and by
all accounts he must have been born several years before Cimabue. He
painted on canvas, and if we may credit Vasari, made the first discovery
of a method of rendering his pictures more durable, and less liable to
cracking. He extended canvas on the panel, laying it down with a strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_015" id="Page_015">[Pg
15]</a></span>glue, made of shreds of parchment, and covered the whole
with a ground of gypsum, before he began to paint. He formed diadems and
other ornaments of plaster, giving them relief from gilding and
burnishing them. Some of his crucifixions remain in Arezzo, and one of
them is in the church of the Holy Cross at Florence, near another by
Cimabue; both are in the old manner, and not so different in point of
merit, but that Margaritone, however rude, may be pronounced as well
entitled as Cimabue to the name of painter.</p>

<p>While the neighbouring cities had made approaches towards the new
style, Florence, if we are to credit Vasari and his followers, was
without a painter; but subsequent to the year 1250 some Greek painters
were invited to Florence by the rulers of the city, for the express
purpose of restoring the art of painting in Florence, where it was
rather wholly lost than degenerated. To this assertion I have to oppose
the learned dissertation of Doctor Lami, which I have just commended.
Lami observes, that mention is made in the archives of the chapters of
one Bartolommeo who painted in 1236, and that the picture of the
Annunciation of our Lady, which is held in the highest veneration in the
church of the Servi, was painted about that period. It is retouched in
some parts of the drapery; it possesses, however, much originality, and
for that age is respectably executed. When I prepared my first edition I
had no knowledge of the work of Lami, which was not then published,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_016" id="Page_016">[Pg
16]</a></span>and hence was unable to proceed further than to refute the
opinion of those who ascribed this sacred figure to Cavallini, a pupil
of Giotto. I reflected that the style of Cavallini appeared considerably
more modern in his other works which I had examined at Assisi, and at
Florence; yet, various artists whom I consulted, and among others Signor
Pacini, who had copied the Annunciation, disputed with me this diversity
of style. I further adduced the form of the characters written there in
a book, <i>Ecce Virgo concipiet, &amp;c.</i> which resemble those of the
thirteenth century; nor have they that profusion of lines which
distinguishes the German, commonly denominated the Gothic character,
which Cavallini and other pupils of Giotto always employed. I rejoice
that the opinion of Lami confirms my conjecture, and stamps its
authenticity; and it seems to me highly probable that the Bartolommeo,
whom he indicates, is the individual to whom the memorandums of the
Servi ascribe the production of their Annunciation about the year 1250.
The same religious fraternity preserve, among their ancient paintings, a
Magdalen, which appears from the design and inscription, a work of the
thirteenth century; and we might instance several coeval pictures that
still exist in their chapter house, and in other parts of the city.<a
name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42"
class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_017" id="Page_017">[Pg
17]</a></span>Having inserted these notices of ancient painters, and
some others, which will be found scattered throughout the work, I turn
to Vasari, and to the accusations laid to his charge. He is defended by
Monsignor Bottari in a note at the conclusion of the life of
Margaritone, taken from Baldinucci. He affirms, from his own
observation, "That though each city had some painters, they were all as
contemptible and barbarous as Margaritone, who, if compared to Cimabue,
is unworthy of the name of painter." The examples already cited do not
permit me to assent to this proposition; even Bottari himself will
scarcely allow me to do so, as he observes, in another note on the life
of Cimabue, "That he was the first who abandoned the manner of the
Greeks, or at least who avoided it more completely than any other
artist." But if others, such as Guido, Bonaventura, and Giunta, had
freed themselves from it before his time, why are they not recorded as
the first, in point of time, by Vasari? Did not their <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_018" id="Page_018">[Pg
18]</a></span>example open the new path to Cimabue? Did they not afford
a ray of light to reviving art? Were they not in painting what the two
Guidos were in poetry, who, however much surpassed by Dante, are
entitled to the first place in a history of our poets? Vasari would
therefore have acted better had he followed the example of Pliny, who
commences with the rude designers, Ardices of Corinth, and Telephanes of
Sicyon; he then minutely narrates the invention of Cleophantes the
Corinthian, who coloured his designs with burnt earth; next, that of
Eumarus the Athenian, who first represented the distinction of age and
sex. Then comes that of Cimon of Cleonæ, who first expressed the various
attitudes of the head, and aimed at representing the truth, even in the
joints of the fingers and the folds of the garments. Thus, the merits of
each city, and every artist, appear in ancient history; and it seems to
me just, that the same should be done, as far as possible, in modern
history. These observations may, at present, suffice in regard to a
subject that has been made a source of complaint and dispute among many
writers.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it cannot be denied that there is no city to which
painting is more indebted than to Florence, nor any name more proper to
mark an epoch, whatever may be the opinion of Padre della Valle,<a
name="fnanchor_43" id="fnanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43"
class="fnanchor">[43]</a> than that of Cimabue. The artists <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_019" id="Page_019">[Pg 19]</a></span>whom
I have before mentioned had few followers; their schools, with the
exception of that of Siena, languished, and were either gradually
dispersed, or united themselves to that of Florence. This school in a
short time eclipsed every other, and has continued to flourish in a
proud succession of artists, uninterrupted even down to our own days.
Let us then trace it from its commencement.</p>

<p>Giovanni Cimabue, descended from illustrious ancestors,<a
name="fnanchor_44" id="fnanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44"
class="fnanchor">[44]</a> was both an architect and a painter. That he
was the pupil of Giunta is conjectured in our times, only because the
Greeks were less skilful <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_020"
id="Page_020">[Pg 20]</a></span>than the Italians. It ought to be a
previous question, whether the supposed scholar and master ever resided
in the same place, which it would seem, after the observations before
adduced, can scarcely be admitted.<a name="fnanchor_45"
id="fnanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It
appears from history, that he learnt the art from some Greeks who were
invited to Florence, and painted in S. Maria Novella, according to
Vasari. It is an error to assert that they painted in the chapel of the
Gondi, which was built a century after, together with the church; it was
certainly in another chapel, under the church, where those Greek
paintings were covered with plaister, and their place supplied by
others, the work of a painter of the thirteenth century.<a
name="fnanchor_46" id="fnanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46"
class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Not long since a part of the new plaister fell down, and some of the
very rude figures of those <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_021"
id="Page_021">[Pg 21]</a></span>Greek painters became again visible. It
is probable that Cimabue imitated them in early life, and perhaps at
that time painted the S. Francesco and the little legends which surround
it in the church of S. Croce. But, if I mistake not, it is doubtful who
painted this picture; at least it neither has the manner nor the
colouring of the works of Cimabue, even when young. I may refer to the
S. Cecilia, with the implements of her martyrdom, in the church
dedicated to that Saint, and which was afterwards removed to that of San
Stefano, a picture greatly superior to that of S. Francesco.</p>

<p>However this may be, like other Italians of his age, Giovanni got the
better of his Greek education, which seems to have consisted in one
artist copying another without ever adding any thing to the practice of
his master. He consulted nature, he corrected in part the rectilinear
forms of his design, he gave expression to the heads, he folded the
drapery, and he grouped the figures with much greater art than the
Greeks. His talent did not consist in the graceful. His Madonnas have no
beauty, his angels in the same piece have all the same forms. Wild as
the age in which he lived, he succeeded admirably in heads full of
character, especially in those of old men, impressing an indescribable
degree of bold sublimity, which the moderns have not been able greatly
to surpass. Vast and inventive in conception, he executed large
compositions, and expressed them in grand proportions. His two great
altar-pieces of the Madonna, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_022"
id="Page_022">[Pg 22]</a></span>at Florence, the one in the church of
the Dominicans, the other in that of the Trinity, with the grand figures
of the prophets, do not give so good an idea of his style as his fresco
paintings in the church of Assisi, where he appears truly magnificent
for the age in which he lived. In these histories of the Old and New
Testament, such as remain, he appears an Ennius, who, amid the rudeness
of Roman epic poetry, gave flashes of genius not displeasing to a
Virgil. Vasari speaks of him with admiration for the vigour of his
colouring, and justly so of the pictures in the ceiling. They are still
in a good state of preservation, and although some of the figures of
Christ, and of the Virgin in particular, retain much of the Greek
manner, others representing the Evangelists, and Doctors instructing the
Monks of the Franciscan Order, from their chairs, exhibit an originality
of conception and arrangement that does not appear in contemporary
works. The colouring is bold, the proportions are gigantic even in the
distance, and not badly preserved; in short, painting may there be said
to have almost advanced beyond what the mosaic worker at first attempted
to do. The whole of these, indeed, are steps in the progress of the
human intellect not to be recounted in one history, and form beyond
question the distinguishing excellence of the Florentine artist, when
put into competition with either the Pisans or the Sienese. Nor do I
perceive how, after the authority of Vasari, who assigns the work of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_023" id="Page_023">[Pg
23]</a></span>the ceiling to Cimabue, confirmed by the tradition of five
centuries, P. della Valle is justified at this day, in ascribing that
painting to Giotto, a painter of a milder genius. If he was induced to
prefer other artists to Cimabue, because they gave the eyes less
fierceness, and the nose a finer shape, these circumstances appear to me
too insignificant to degrade Cimabue from that rank which he enjoys in
impartial history.<a name="fnanchor_47" id="fnanchor_47"></a><a
href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> He has moreover asserted,
that Cimabue neither promoted nor injured the Florentine school by his
productions, a harsh judgment, in the opinion of those who have perused
so many old writers belonging to the city who have celebrated his
merits, and of those who have studied the works of the Florentine
artists before his time, and seen how greatly Cimabue surpasses
them.</p>

<p>If Cimabue was the Michelangiolo of that age, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_024" id="Page_024">[Pg
24]</a></span>Giotto was the Raffaello. Painting, in his hands, became
so elegant, that none of his school, nor of any other, till the time of
Masaccio, surpassed, or even equalled him, at least in gracefulness of
manner. Giotto was born in the country, and was bred a shepherd; but he
was likewise born a painter; and continually exercised his genius in
delineating some object or other around him. A sheep which he had drawn
on a flat stone, after nature, attracted the notice of Cimabue, who by
chance passed that way: he demanded leave of his father to take him to
Florence, that he might afford him instruction; confident, that in him,
he was about to raise up a new ornament to the art. Giotto commenced by
imitating his master, but quickly surpassed him. An Annunciation, in the
possession of the Fathers of Badia, is one of his earliest works. The
style is somewhat dry, but shews a grace and diligence, that announced
the improvement we afterwards discern. Through him symmetry became more
chaste, design more pleasing, and colouring softer than before. The
meagre hands, the sharp pointed feet, and staring eyes, remnants of the
Grecian manner, all acquired more correctness under him.</p>

<p>It is not possible to assign the cause of this transition, as we are
able to do in the case of later painters; but it is reasonable to
conclude that it was not wholly produced, even by the almost divine
genius of this artist, unaided by adventitious circumstances. There is
no necessity for sending <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_025"
id="Page_025">[Page 25]</a></span>him, as some have done, to be
instructed at Pisa; his history does not warrant it, and an historian is
not a diviner. Much less ought we to refer him to the school of F.
Jacopo da Turrita, and give him Memmi and Lorenzetti for fellow pupils,
who are not known to have been in Rome when F. Jacopo was distinguished
for his best manner. But P. della Valle thinks he discovers in Giotto's
first painting, the style and composition of Giunta, (Preface to Vasari,
p. 17,) and in the pictures of Giotto at S. Croce, in Florence, which
"<i>he has meditated upon a hundred times</i>," he recognizes F. Jacopo,
and finds "<i>reason for opining</i>" that he was the master of Giotto.
(Vide tom. ii. p. 78.) When a person becomes attached to a system, he
often sees and opines what no one else can possibly see or opine. In the
same manner Baldinucci wished to refer to the school of Giotto, one
Duccio da Siena, Vital di Bologna, and many others, as will be noticed;
and he too argues upon a resemblance of style, which, to say truth,
neither I nor any one I know can perceive. If I cannot then agree with
Baldinucci, can I value his imitator? and more particularly as it is no
question here of Vitale, or any other artist of mediocrity, almost
unknown to history, but of Giotto himself. Is it likely, with a genius
such as his, and born in an age not wholly barbarous, with the
advantages enjoyed under Cimabue, especially in point of colouring, that
he would take Giunta for his model, or listen to the instruction of Fra
Mino, in order to excel his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_026"
id="Page_026">[Pg 26]</a></span>master. Besides, what advantage can be
obtained from thus disturbing the order of chronology, violating
history, and rejecting the tradition of Giotto's native school, in order
to account for his new style?</p>

<p>It is most probable that, as the great Michelangiolo, by modelling
and studying the antique, quickly surpassed in painting his master,
Ghirlandaio, the same occurred with regard to Giotto. It is at least
known that he was also a sculptor, and that his models were preserved
till the time of Lorenzo Ghiberti. Nor was he without good examples.
There were specimens of antique sculpture at Florence, which may be yet
seen near the cathedral, (not to mention those which he afterwards saw
at Rome); and their merit, then already established by the practice of
Niccola and Giovanni of Pisa, could not be unknown to Giotto, to whom
nature had granted such a taste for the exquisite and the beautiful.
When one contemplates some of his heads of men; some of his forms,
proportioned far beyond the littleness of his contemporaries; his taste
in flowing, natural, and becoming drapery; some of his attitudes after
the manner of the antique, breathing grace and tranquillity, it is
scarce possible to doubt that he derived no small advantage from ancient
sculpture. His very defects discover this. A good writer (the author of
the Guide of Bologna) remarks in him a style which partakes of statuary,
contrary to the practice of contemporary foreign artists; a circumstance
very common, as we shall observe, under <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_027" id="Page_027">[Pg 27]</a></span>the Roman school, to
those painters who designed from statues. I shall be told that he
probably derived assistance from the sculpture of the two Pisani;
especially as Baldinucci has discovered a strong resemblance between his
style and that of Giovanni, and some others also have noticed the
circular compositions, the proportions and casting of the drapery which
one perceives in the <ins title="not hyphenated in the
original">basso-relievos</ins> of the early Pisan school. I would not
deny that he also availed himself of them; but it was perhaps in the
manner that Raffaello profited by Michelangiolo, whose example taught
him to imitate the antique. Nor let it be objected to me that the
dryness of the design, the artifice of concealing the feet by long
garments, the inaccuracy of the extremities, and similar defects, betray
rather a Pisan than an Attic origin. This only proves, that when he
became the founder of a style, he did not aim at giving it the
perfection of which it was susceptible, and which it could hardly be
expected to obtain amid the numerous avocations in which he appears to
have been engaged; in short, I cannot persuade myself, that without the
imitation of the antique, he could in so short a time have made such a
progress, as to have been admired even by Bonarruoti himself.<a
name="fnanchor_48" id="fnanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48"
class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The first histories of the patriarch S. Francesco, at Assisi, near
the paintings of his master, shew how greatly he excelled him. As his
work advanced <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_028" id="Page_028">[Pg
28]</a></span>he became more correct; and towards the conclusion, he
already manifested a design more varied in the countenances, and
improved in the extremities; the features are more animated, the
attitudes more ingenious, and the landscape more natural. To one who
examines them with attention, the composition appears the most
surprising; a branch of the art, in which he seems not only to surpass
himself, but even sometimes appears unrivalled. In many historical
pictures, he often aimed at ornamenting with buildings, which he painted
of a red, or azure, or a yellow, the colours employed in staining
houses, or of a dazzling white, in imitation of Parian marble. One of
his best pictures in this work is that of a thirsty person, to the
expression of which scarcely any thing could be added by the animating
pencil of Raffaello d'Urbino himself. With similar skill he painted in
the inferior church, and this is perhaps the best performance which has
reached our times, though specimens remain in Ravenna, in Padua, in
Rome, in Florence, and in Pisa. It is assuredly the most spirited of
all, for he has there, with the most poetical images, depicted the saint
shunning vice, and a follower of virtue; it is my opinion that he here
gave the first example of symbolical painting, so familiar to his best
followers.</p>

<p>His inventions, which, according to the custom of the age, were
employed in scripture history, are repeated by him in nearly the same
style in several <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_029"
id="Page_029">[Pg 29]</a></span>places; and are generally most pleasing
when the proportions of the figures are the least. His small pictures of
the Acts of St. Peter and St. Paul, with some representations of our
Saviour, and of various saints, in the sacristy of the Vatican, appear
most elegant and highly finished miniatures; as likewise are some others
in the church of the Holy Cross at Florence, taken from scriptural
history, or from the life of St. Francis. The real art of portrait
painting commenced with him; to whom we are indebted for correct
likenesses of Dante, of Brunetto Latini, and of Corso Donati. It was
indeed before attempted, but, according to Vasari, no one had succeeded.
He also improved the art of working in mosaic; a piece wrought by him in
the Navicella, or ship of St. Peter, may be seen in the portico of that
cathedral; but it has been so much repaired, that now the design is
wholly different, and appears the work of another artist. It is believed
that the art of miniature painting, so much prized in that age for the
ornamenting of missals, received great improvement from him.<a
name="fnanchor_49" id="fnanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49"
class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Architecture undoubtedly did; the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_030" id="Page_030">[Pg
30]</a></span>admirable belfry of the cathedral of Florence is the work
of Giotto.</p>

<p>After collecting all the notices he could of the scholars of Cimabue
and Giotto, Baldinucci endeavours to make us believe that all the
benefits which accrued to painting, sculpture, and architecture in
Italy, and even throughout the world, came directly or indirectly from
Florence. The following is the manner in which he expresses himself in
his first pages, with the proofs which he adduces. "During my
researches, I have ascertained beyond all doubt the truth of an opinion
I always considered as indisputable, and which is not controverted by
respectable ancient historians; that these arts in the first place were
restored by Cimabue and Giotto, and afterwards diffused over the world
by their disciples; and I conceived the idea of making it evident by the
help of a tree, which at a glance might shew their progress from the
earliest to the present times." He published the first small part of
this tree, just as I exhibit it to the reader; and promised in each
succeeding volume to give another part, that would establish the
connexion with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_031"
id="Page_031">[Pg 31]</a></span>the principal root (Cimabue), or with
the branches derived from it; a promise from which he adroitly delivered
himself; therefore we are without any more than these few branches that
follow:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/chart.jpg"
width="450" height="200" alt="Illustration: Chart" title="Chart" />
</div>

<p>But with all his pains he has not satisfied the public expectation,
as is observed by Signor Piacenza, who published the splendid Turin
edition of Baldinucci as far as the life of Franciabigio, accompanied
with very useful notes and dissertations.<a name="fnanchor_50"
id="fnanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> It
is alleged, that to make this tree fair and flourishing, he has inserted
in it branches dexterously stolen from his neighbours, who have not
failed to reclaim their property. I rejoice to write in an age when the
opinions of Baldinucci have few followers even in Florence. The
excellent work entitled "<i>Etruria Pittrice</i>," composed and
applauded in that city in proportion as it is free from the prejudice of
former times, proves this sufficiently. Following in like manner the
light of history and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_032"
id="Page_032">[Pg 32]</a></span>of reason, unswayed by party spirit, I
shall in the first place observe, that among all the scholars of
Cimabue, I do not find any named by Vasari, but Giotto and Arnolfo di
Lapo, concerning whom it is certain that the historian was in error.
Lapo and Arnolfo are the names of two different sculptors,
<i>disciples</i> of Niccolò Pisano, who, being already versed in the
art, assisted him in 1266 to adorn with history pieces the pulpit of the
cathedral at Siena, an authentic document of which remains in the
archives of the work.<a name="fnanchor_51" id="fnanchor_51"></a><a
href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Thus this branch of the
tree belongs to Pisa, unless Cimabue have a claim to it, by contributing
in some degree to the instruction of Arnolfo in the principles of
architecture. Andrea Tafi was the pupil of Apollonius, a Greek artist,
and assisted him in the church of St. John, in some pieces of mosaic,
from scriptural history, which, according to Vasari, are without
invention and without design; but he improved as he proceeded, for the
last part of the work was less despicable than the beginning. Cimabue is
not named in these works, nor in what Tafi afterwards executed without
assistance; and as he was old when Cimabue began to teach, I cannot
conceive how he can be reckoned the scholar of the latter, or a branch
from that root. Gaddo Gaddi, says Vasari, was contemporary with Cimabue,
and was his intimate friend, as well as that of Tafi; through their
friendship he received <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_033"
id="Page_033">[Pg 33]</a></span>hints for his improvement in mosaic. At
first he followed the manner of the Greeks, mingled with that of
Cimabue. After long working in this manner, he went to Rome, and there
improved his style, while employed on the façade of S. Maria Maggiore,
by his own genius, assisted in my opinion by imitating the ancient
workers in mosaic. He also painted some altar-pieces, and I saw at
Florence one of his crucifixions, of a square figure, and very
respectable workmanship. This circumstance induces me to consider Gaddo,
in some measure, among the imitators of Cimabue, but not one of his
pupils; for it appears to me unjust, should a contemporary communicate
with an artist either as a friend, or for the sake of advice on the art,
to set him immediately down as a branch from that stock. Vasari relates
of Ugolino Senese, that he was a tenacious follower of the Greek style,
and inclined more to imitate Cimabue than Giotto. He does not on this
account, indeed, expressly say, that he had been his scholar; he rather
hints that he had other instructors at Siena, for which reason it will
be better to consider him under that school, there being no reason to
doubt that he belonged to it. In that of Bologna we should also class
Oderigo, who, as a miniature painter, was more likely to employ some
other master than a painter in fresco like Cimabue. In the mean time it
is useful to reflect, that were the method of Baldinucci to be pursued,
nothing authentic would remain in a history of painting; and the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_034" id="Page_034">[Pg 34]</a></span>
schools of the early masters would increase beyond all limits, were the
scholars of each master to be confounded with his friends,
acquaintances, and contemporaries, who paid attention to his maxims.</p>

<p>It is still more strange to peruse the account of the connexion
between the first and secondary branches of the tree, or if one may use
the expression, between the children and grandchildren of Cimabue. There
is nothing natural in their succession, and the labour is wholly useless
which derives the professors of every fine art, of whatever country,
past, present, and to come, from one individual. F. Ristoro and F. Sisto
were eminent architects, who rebuilt the grand bridges of the Carraja
and the Holy Trinity, about 1264, when Cimabue was twenty-four years of
age. Baldinucci writes of both, that they were, perhaps, disciples or
imitators of Arnolfo, from the state of their works. But how comes he to
found on a <i>perhaps</i>, what he, a little before, had vaunted as a
<i>clear demonstration</i>? And then, on what does this <i>perhaps</i>
rest? Is it not more probable that Arnolfo, and Cimabue himself,
imitated them? That Fra Mino da Turrita should appear in his tree as a
scholar of Tafi, and as posterior to Cimabue, is no less absurd. In
1225, a date omitted by Baldinucci, Mino wrought in mosaic at Florence,
fifteen years before Cimabue was born. In his old age he commenced a
similar work in the cathedral of Pisa, "in the same style in which he
had executed his other labours," says Vasari, who adds,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_035" id="Page_035">[Pg 35]</a></span> that
Tafi and Gaddi (both his inferiors in age and reputation) assisted him.
The work was "little more than begun," from which we may infer that they
were not long associated. It seems to me extraordinary how Baldinucci
could assert, "it appears that Vasari imagined that Mino was the pupil
of Andrea Tafi," which is contrary to fact: instead of the "<i>clear
demonstration</i>," which he promised, he has amused us with "<i>it
appears</i>," which is evident only to himself. At length, wishing to
make us believe that Giovanni Pisano the sculptor is a <i>pupil</i> of
Giotto the painter, he again turns to Vasari, from whom he brings
evidence that Giovanni, having completed his work in the cathedral of
Arezzo, and being then established at Orvieto, came to Florence to
examine the architecture of S. Maria del Fiore, and to become acquainted
with Giotto: he further notices two pieces which he executed at
Florence, the one a Madonna between two little angels, over the gate of
the cathedral; the other a small baptism of St. John; this happened in
1297. Here Baldinucci hazards a reflection, that "if one compares the
other works of this artist with the above mentioned figure of the Virgin
Mary ... we may recognize in it such improvement ... and so much of the
manner of Giotto, that there cannot remain a doubt but he is to be
reckoned a disciple of this master, both in respect of his imitation of
him, and his observance of his precepts, <i>which he followed during so
many years in the exercise</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_036"
id="Page_036">[Pg 36]</a></span><i>of the profession</i>." Every
attentive reader will discover here not a clear demonstration of the
assumption, but a mass of difficulties. He compares this to the other
figures made by Pisano at Florence, before he was acquainted with
Giotto; and yet this was the first which he there executed. He wishes to
make Giovanni, already sixty years of age, an imitator of Giotto, then
twenty-one, when it is much more probable that Giotto would follow him,
the best sculptor of the age. There is no foundation for the supposed
instruction which Giovanni received from Giotto, who, shortly after,
departed for Rome; where, after some other works, he executed the mosaic
of the <i>boat</i> in 1298. In short, the whole question of
preceptorship rests on no better authority than a single figure. How
great are the inconsistencies in this account, and how absurd the
explanations and repetitions which are offered! What further shall we
say? Is it not lamentable thus to see so many old and honoured artists
compelled, in spite of history, to become pupils to masters so much
younger and less celebrated than themselves? I know that various writers
have censured Baldinucci as an historian of doubtful fidelity, artful in
concealing or misrepresenting facts, captious in expounding the opinions
of Vasari, and more intent on captivating than instructing his readers.
I am not ignorant that his system was controverted even in his own
country, as appears from his work published there, entitled <i>Delle
Veglie</i>; and that Signor Marmi, a learned Florentine, strongly
suspected his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_037" id="Page_037">[Pg
37]</a></span>fair dealing, of which we shall adduce a proof under the
Sienese school. Nevertheless I take into account that he wrote in an age
less informed in regard to the history of painting, and that he defended
an opinion then much more common in Italy than at present. He had
promised Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici to demonstrate it incontrovertibly
for the honour of his country, and of the house of Medici, and had
received advice and assistance from him in order to encourage him to
defend it, and to refute the contrary opinion. Under the necessity of
answering Malvasia,<a name="fnanchor_52" id="fnanchor_52"></a><a
href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> a severe writer against
Vasari, and of proving his assertion, that the people of Bologna, no
less than those of Siena, of Pisa, and other places, had learned the art
from the Florentines, he formed a false system, the absurdity of which
he did not immediately perceive; but he at last discovered it, as Signor
Piacenza observes, and succeeded in escaping from its trammels. The most
ingenious builders of systems have subjected themselves very frequently
to the same disadvantage, and the history of literature abounds with
similar instances.</p>

<p>Having examined this sophism, I cannot subscribe to the opinion of
Baldinucci; but shall comprise my own opinion in two
propositions:&mdash;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_038"
id="Page_038">[Pg 38]</a></span> first is, That the improvement of
painting is not due to Florence alone. It has been remarked, that the
career of human genius, in the progress of the fine arts, is the same in
every country. When the man is dissatisfied with what the child learned,
he gradually passes from the ruder elements to what is less so, and from
thence, to diligence and precision; he afterwards advances to the grand,
and the select, and at length attains facility of execution.</p>

<p>Such was the progress of sculpture among the Grecians, and such has
been that of painting in our own country. When Correggio advanced from
laborious minuteness to grandeur, it was not necessary for him to know
that such was the progress of Raffaello, or, at any rate, to have
witnessed it: in like manner, nothing more was wanting to the painters
of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, than to learn that hitherto
they had pursued a wrong path; this was sufficient to guide them into a
better path, and it was not then untried; for sculpture had already
improved design. We have, in fact, seen the Pisani, and their scholars,
preceding the Florentines; and, as their precursors, diffusing a new
system of design over Italy. It would be injustice to overlook them in
the improvement of painting, in which design is of such importance; or
to suppose that they did not signally contribute to its improvement. But
if Italy be indebted solely to Cimabue and Giotto for its progress, all
the good artists should have come from Florence. And yet, in the
cathedral of Orvieto (to instance the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_039" id="Page_039">[Pg 39]</a></span>finest work, perhaps, of
that age), we find, from the beginning of the fourteenth century, many
artists from various other places, who would not have been called to
ornament such a building, had they not previously enjoyed the reputation
of able masters.<a name="fnanchor_53" id="fnanchor_53"></a><a
href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Add to this, if we are to
derive all painters from those two masters, every style of painting
should resemble that of their Florentine disciples. But on examining the
old paintings of Siena, of Venice, of Bologna, and of Parma, they are
found to be dissimilar in idea, in choice of colouring, and in taste of
composition. All, then, are not derived from Florence.</p>

<p>My second proposition is, That no people then excelled in, nor
contributed, by example, so much to the progress of art as the
Florentines. Rival cities may boast artists of merit, even in the first
era of painting; their writers may deny the fame of Giotto and his
disciples; but truth is more powerful than declamation. Giotto was the
father of the new method of painting, as Boccaccio was called the father
of the new species of prose composition. After the time of the latter,
any subject could be elegantly treated of in prose; after the former,
painting could express all subjects with propriety. A Simon da Siena, a
Stefano da Firenze, a Pietro Laurati, added charms to the art; but they
and others owe to Giotto the transition from the old to a new manner. He
essayed it in Tuscany, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_040"
id="Page_040">[Pg 40]</a></span>and while yet a young man, greatly
improved it, to the general admiration of all classes. He did not leave
Assisi until called to Rome by Boniface VIII., nor did he take up his
residence at Avignon, until invited to France by Clement V. Before going
there, he was induced to stop at Padua, and on returning some years
after, he again resided at the same place. At that time many parts of
Italy were under a republican form of government; but abounded in potent
families, that bore sway in various quarters, and which, while adorning
their country, aimed at its subjugation. Giotto, beyond every other, was
in universal request, both at home and abroad. The Polentani of Ravenna,
the Malatesti of Rimino, the Estensi of Ferrara, the Visconti of Milan,
the Scala of Verona, Castruccio of Lucca, and also Robert, king of
Naples, sought to engage him with eagerness, and for some period
retained him in their service. Milan, Urbino, Arezzo, and Bologna, were
desirous to possess his works; and Pisa, that, in her <i>Campo
Santo</i>, afforded an opportunity for the choicest artists of Tuscany
to vie with one another,<a name="fnanchor_54" id="fnanchor_54"></a><a
href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> as of old they contended
at Corinth, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_041" id="Page_041">[Pg
41]</a></span>and in Delphi,<a name="fnanchor_55" id="fnanchor_55"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> obtained from him those
historic paintings from the life of Job, which are greatly admired,
though they are amongst his early productions. When Giotto was no more,
similar applause was bestowed on his disciples: cities contended for the
honour of inviting them, and they were even more highly estimated than
the native artists themselves. We shall find Cavallini and Capanna in
the Roman School; in that of Bologna the two Faentini, Pace, and
Ottaviano, with Guglielmo da Forli; Menabuoi at Padua; Memmi, who was
either a scholar or assistant of Giotto, at Avignon; and we shall find
traces of the successors of the same school throughout all Italy. This
work will indicate the names of some of them; it will point out the
style of others; without including the great number who, in every
province, have been withdrawn from our view, for the purpose of
replacing old pictures with others in the new manner. Giotto thus became
the model for students during the whole of the fourteenth century, as
was Raffaello in the sixteenth, and the Caracci in the subsequent
century: nor can I find a fourth manner that has been so generally
received in Italy as that of those three schools. There have been some
who, from the inspiration of their own genius, had adopted a new manner,
but they were little known or admired beyond the precincts of their own
country. Of the Florentines alone can it be asserted, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_042" id="Page_042">[Pg 42]</a></span>that
they diffused the modern style from one extremity of Italy to the other:
in the restoration of painting, though not all, yet the chief praise
belongs to them; and this forms my second proposition.</p>

<p>I proceed more willingly to the sequel of my work, having escaped
from that part of it in which, amid the contradictory sentiments of
authors, I have often suspended my pen, mindful of the maxim,
<i>Historia nihil falsi audeat dicere, nihil veri non audeat</i>.
Resuming the subject of Florence, after the death of her great artist in
1336, I find painters had there prodigiously multiplied, as I shall
presently, from undoubted testimony, proceed to prove. Not long
afterwards, that is, in 1349, the painters associated themselves into a
religious fraternity, which they denominated the Society of St. Luke,
first established in S. Maria Nuova, but afterwards in S. Maria Novella.
This was not the first that had arisen in Italy, as Baldinucci affirms:
in 1290 there was a company of painters previously established at
Venice, of which St. Luke was the patron, the laws of which, it is
believed, are still preserved in the church of St. Sophia.<a
name="fnanchor_56" id="fnanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56"
class="fnanchor">[56]</a> But neither this, the Florentine, nor that of
Bologna, can be called academies for design; they were only the results
of Christian devotion, a sort of school, such as formerly existed, and
still exist in many of the arts. They did not consist <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_043" id="Page_043">[Pg 43]</a></span>of
painters alone; these always possessed the most elevated rank; but in
the same place were assembled artists "in metal and in wood, whose works
partook, more or less, of design;" as is related by Baldinucci, in
describing the Florentine association. In that of Venice were
comprehended basket-makers, gilders, and the lowest daubers; in that of
Bologna were included even saddlers, and scabbard-makers; who were only
divided from the painters by means of lawsuits and decisions. That
unrefined age did not as yet acknowledge the dignity of painting; it
denominated those artists master workmen, whom we now call professors of
the art, and it called shops what we name studies. I have often doubted,
whether the progress of the arts was so rapid among us as in Greece,
because, there, painting, either from the beginning or a very early era,
was considered as a liberal art: with us its dignity was much longer in
being acknowledged.</p>

<p>He who desires to discover the origin of those associations, will
find it in the works composed of different arts then most in use, of
which I shall treat somewhat fully, for the sake of illustrating the
history. A little above I mentioned basket-makers: at that time, all
kinds of furniture, such as cupboards, benches, and chests, were wrought
by mechanics, and then painted, especially when intended as the
furniture of new married women. Many ancient cabinet pictures have been
cut out of such pieces of furniture, and, by this means, preserved <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044">[Pg 44]</a></span>to
later ages. As for images on altars, through the whole of the fourteenth
century, they were not formed, as at present, on a separate piece from
the surrounding ornaments. There were made little altars, or dittici,<a
name="fnanchor_57" id="fnanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a> in many parts of Italy, called <i>Ancone</i>;
they first shaped the wood, and laboriously ornamented it with carving.
The design was conformed to the Teutonic, or, as it is called, the
Gothic architecture, seen in the façades of churches built in that age.
The whole work was a load of minuteness, consisting of little
tabernacles, pyramids, and niches; and various doors and windows, with
semi-circular and pointed arches, were represented on the surface of the
panel; a style very characteristic of that period. I have sometimes
there observed, in the middle, little statues in <ins
title="'mezzo-rilievo' in the original">mezzo-relievo</ins>.<a
name="fnanchor_58" id="fnanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58"
class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Most frequently the painter designed these
figures or busts of saints: sometimes there were also prepared various
sorts of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_045" id="Page_045">[Pg
45]</a></span>little forms, or moulds&mdash;formelle&mdash;in which to
represent histories. Often there was a step added to the little altar,
where, in several compartments, were likewise exhibited histories of our
Saviour, of the Virgin, and of the martyrs, either real or feigned.<a
name="fnanchor_59" id="fnanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59"
class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Sometimes various compartments were prepared,
in which their lives were represented. The carvers in wood were so vain
of their craft, that they often inscribed their own names before that of
the painter.<a name="fnanchor_60" id="fnanchor_60"></a><a
href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Even pictures for rooms were fashioned by the carvers into triangular
and square forms, which they surrounded with heavy borders, with rude
foliage, lace, or Arabesque ornaments around them. In that age, pictures
were rarely committed to canvass alone, though some such are to be seen
at Florence, and more among the Venetians and people of Bologna; but
panels were most frequently employed. The borders often inclosed
portions of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_046" id="Page_046">[Pg
46]</a></span>canvass, not unfrequently of parchment, and sometimes of
leather, which, in all probability, were prepared by those who usually
wrought in such materials; and this is the reason why such artists, and
even in some instances saddlers, were sometimes associated with
painters.</p>

<p>History informs us that shields for war, or the tournament, and also
various equestrian accoutrements, as the saddles and trappings of
horses, were ornamented with painting, a custom which was retained till
the time of Francia, as Vasari mentions in his life; hence, armourers
and saddlers became associated with painters. Among them in like manner
might be included those who prepared walls for painting in fresco, and
who covered them with a reddish ground, which not unfrequently is still
discovered in the flaws. On this colour the figures were designed, and
such walls were the cartoons of the old masters. The stucco workers also
assisted them in those relieved ornaments we see in fresco paintings. I
believe they used moulds in those works, which seem nothing else than
globules, flowerets, and little stars, formed with a stamp, such as we
see on gilt plaister, on leather, on board, and on playing-cards. On
whatever substance they painted, some gold was usually added; with it
they ornamented the ground of their pictures, the glories of their
saints, their garments, and fringes. Although painters themselves were
skilled in such labours, it appears that they sought the assistance of
gilders, and therefore gilders <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_047"
id="Page_047">[Pg 47]</a></span>were classed with painters, and like
them inscribed works with their names.</p>

<p>This was the practice of Cini and Saracini, just before recorded, and
particularly of a native of Ferrara, who, in the pictures of the
Vivarini, at Venice, subscribes his name before theirs. (<i>See Zanetti,
Pittura Ven.</i> p. 15.) And in the cathedral of Ceneda, below an
Incoronation of the Virgin, in which the artist did not care to exhibit
himself to posterity, the engraver, already noticed, left the following
inscription, which Signor Lorenzo Giustiniani, a Venetian patrician of
great taste and cultivation of mind, has very politely communicated to
me; "1438, <span class="smcap">a di</span> 10. <span
class="smcap">Frever Christofalo da Ferara intajo.</span>"</p>

<p>Towards the end of the fourteenth century, when the gothic style was
disappearing from architecture, the design of the carvers improved, and
they began to erect over altars oblong panels, divided by partitions,
which were fashioned into pilasters, or small columns, and often between
these last feigned gates or windows, so that the ancona or altar bore
some resemblance to the façade of a palace or a church; over them was
placed a frieze, and above the frieze was a place like a stage with some
figures. The saints were placed below, and their histories were painted
in the compartments; and often there appeared their histories painted
upon some little form, or upon the steps. The partitions were gradually
removed, the proportions of the figures enlarged, and the saints were
disposed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_048" id="Page_048">[Pg
48]</a></span>in a single piece around the throne of our Lord, not so
erect as formerly, after the manner of statues, but in different actions
and positions, a custom which prevailed even in the sixteenth century.
The practice of gilding grounds declined towards the end of the
fifteenth century, but it was increased on the garments, and fringes
were never so deep as at that period. About the close of that century
gold was more sparingly employed, and it was almost wholly abandoned in
the following. No little benefit would be conferred upon the art by any
one who would undertake to point out with accuracy what were the
colours, gums, and other mixtures employed by the Greeks. They were
undoubtedly in possession of the best methods transmitted to them by a
tradition, which though in some measure corrupted, was confessedly
derived from their ancestors. Even subsequent to the invention of oils,
their colouring is in some degree deserving of our admiration. In the
Medicean Museum there is a Madonna, subscribed with the following Latin
inscription, <i>Andreas Rico de Candia pinxit</i>, the forms of which
are stupid, the folds inelegant, and the composition coarse; but with
all this, the colour is so fresh, vivid, and brilliant, that there is no
modern work that would not lose by a comparison; indeed, the colouring
is so extremely strong and firm, that when tried with the iron, it does
not liquefy, but rather scales off, and breaks in minute portions. The
frescos, likewise, of the earliest Greek and Italian painters, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_049" id="Page_049">[Pg 49]</a></span>are
surprisingly strong, and more particularly in upper than in lower Italy.
There are some figures of saints upon the pilasters of the church of San
Niccolo, at Trevigi, quite remarkable for their durability, an account
of which is given in the first volume of Padre Federici, (p. 188). I
have understood from professors that such a degree of <i>consistency</i>
must have been produced by a certain portion of wax, which was employed
at that period, as will be explained in the subsequent chapter, on the
subject of painting in oil. It must, however, be admitted, that we are
very little advanced in these inquiries into the ancient methods of
preparing colour. Were they once satisfactorily explored, it would prove
highly useful in the restoration of ancient pictures, nor superfluous in
regard to the adoption of that firm, fused, and lucid colouring, which
we shall have occasion to commend in various Lombard and Venetian
pictures, and more especially in those of Coreggio.</p>

<p>These observations will not be useless to the connoisseur, who doubts
the age of a picture on which there are no characters. Where there are
letters he may proceed with still greater certainty. The letters
vulgarly called gothic, began to be used after the year 1200, in some
places more early than in others; and characters were loaded with a
superfluity of lines, through the whole of the fourteenth, until about
the middle of the fifteenth century, when the use of the Roman alphabet
was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_050" id="Page_050">[Pg
50]</a></span>revived. What forms were adopted by artists in subscribing
their names, will be more conveniently explained in the course of a few
pages further. I have judged it proper to give here a sort of paleology
of painting; because inattention to this has been, and still is, a
fruitful source of error. The reader, however, may observe, that though
the rules here proposed, afford some light to resolve doubtful points,
they are not to be considered as infallible and universal, and he may
further recollect, that in matters of antiquity nothing is more
dangerous and ridiculous, than to form general rules, which a single
example may be sufficient to overthrow.</p>

There were similar remains in the choir, the design of which I have

The lateral gate of bronze is of very rude workmanship, as described by
the Canon Martini, in his account of that temple, p. 85; and by Sig. da
Morrona, it is with much probability ascribed to the hand of Bonanno
Pisano. From Vasari's life of Arnalfo, we learn that the same sculptor
also executed the great gate of the Primaziale at Pisa, in bronze, about
the year 1180, subsequently destroyed by fire. That of Santa Maria Nuova
at Monreale, is likewise his. It is described by P. del Giudice, in his
account of that church, and bears the name of Bonanno Pisano, with the
date 1186. It is as rudely executed as the preceding one at Pisa, as I
am assured by the Cavalier Puccini, accurately versed in every branch of
the fine arts. If we wish to estimate the merit of Niccola Pisano, we
have only to compare these two gates with the specimens which he gave us
only a few years afterwards.</p>

particularly at Mazzerra and Girganti. At Palermo, the tomb of the
Empress Constance II. who died in the year 1222, is decorated with an
antique sculpture in basso relievo, representing a chase, which is
conjectured to represent that of Æneas and Dido, and which is well
engraved. See the work entitled, "I Regali Sepolchri del Duomo di
Palermo riconosciuti e illustrati. Nap. 1784."</p>

<p class="footnote">Another specimen of this sort is said to be in the

In the new Guide to Milan, Sig. Abate Bianconi observes, "that these are
beautiful works, and that nothing superior is to be seen in any work of
that age. Vasari, by omitting this very eminent Pisan, and not
mentioning these works, although he was according to his own account at
Milan, has given reason to believe, that he was not over anxious in his
researches." p. 215.</p>

The mosaic school subsisted at Rome as early as the eleventh and twelfth
centuries. (See Musant. Fax Chronol. pp. 319, 338.) In this the family
of the Cosmati acquired great excellence. Adeodato di Cosimo Cosmati
employed himself in the church of St. Maria Maggiore, in 1290, (Guide to
Rome); and several of the same name exercised their talents in the
cathedral of Orvieto. (See Valle Catalogo.) The whole of these are
preferred to the Greek mosaic workers, who were at the same period
engaged in decorating St. Mark's at Venice. (See Valle's Preface to
Vasari, p. 61.)</p>

In the sacristy of the Angioli is preserved the most ancient portrait of

To this list of early painters might perhaps be added the name of
Francesco Benani, by whom there is a whole length figure of St. Jerome
holding a crucifix in his hand. It possesses all the characteristics
attributed by Lanzi to this early age. Near the bottom of the picture is
a label, inscribed, Franciscus Benanus, Filius Petri Ablada. The size of
the picture is 2 feet 8 by 2 feet 2, on panel, covered with gypsum. The
vehicle of the colours is probably prepared from eggs, which were
usually employed for that purpose before the invention of painting in
oil, and to which an absorbent ground of lime or gypsum seems to have
been indispensable. It is surprising how well the early pictures
executed in this style have preserved their colouring to the present
day.</p>

This writer has thrown much light upon the history of our early
painters, from which I have derived and shall continue to derive, much
benefit; but in the heat of dispute, he has frequently depreciated
Cimabue in a way which I cannot approve. For instance, Vasari having
said, that "he contributed greatly to the perfection of the art," della
Valle asserts, that "he did it neither good nor harm;" and that having
closely examined the pictures of Cimabue, "he has found in them a ruder
style than appears in those of Giunta Pisano, of Guido da Siena, of
Jacopo da Turrita, &amp;c." (tom. i. p. 235.) Of the two last I shall
speak elsewhere. With respect to the first, the writer contradicts
himself four pages after; when, commenting on another passage of the
historian relating to certain pictures of Cimabue, executed in Assisi in
the inferior church of S. Francesco, he says, that "he there, in his
opinion, surpassed Giunta Pisano." It is to be remembered that this was
his first work, or amongst the first that Cimabue painted in Assisi.
When he went thither, therefore, he was a better artist than Giunta.
How, then, when he worked in the superior church, in Assisi, and in so
many other places, did he become so bad a painter, and more uncouth than
Giunta himself?</p>

We read, in the preface to the Sienese edition of Vasari's Lives, (p.
17) as follows: "To Giunta and to the other artists of Pisa, as heads of
the school, was given the principal direction of adorning the Franciscan
church; and Cimabue and Giotto are known to have been either disciples
or assistants in their school, in which they produced several important
works. Giunta had the direction of his assistant as long as he resided
there, which may have been even subsequent to 1236. But how are we to
suppose that he could have been at Assisi so long as to permit Cimabue
(who was born in 1240, and went to Assisi about 1265) to assist, to
receive instructions from, and to succeed him? Such a supposition is
still more untenable as regards Giotto, who was invited to Assisi many
years afterwards." (Vasari.)</p>

To the testimonies in favor of Cimabue, may be added one of no little
weight, from the manuscript given to the public a few years since, by
the Abbate Morelli. We there find that Cimabue painted in Padua, in the
church del Carmine, which was afterwards burnt; but that a head of S.
Giovanni, by him, being rescued from the flames, was inserted in a
frame, and preserved in the house of Alessandro Capella. Would a
painter, who had done neither good nor harm to the Florentine school,
and to the art, have been invited to Padua? Would the remains of his
works have been held in such esteem? Would he have been so highly
valued, after so great a lapse of time, by Vasari, to whose arts he
seems to wish to ascribe the reputation of Cimabue. Other proofs of this
reputation may be seen in the defence of Vasari, in the present Book,
third Epoch. The writer of history ought completely to divest himself of
the love of system and party spirit.</p>

A book is mentioned by Baldinucci ornamented by Giotto with miniatures,
with histories from the Old Testament, and presented to the vestry of
St. Peter, by Cardinal Stefaneschi; of this he neither adduces any
proof, nor can I find any record. From the evidence, rather, of an
existing necrology, where, among the presents made by Stefaneschi to the
cathedral, the pictures and the mosaic by Giotto are noticed without any
other work of this artist, the gift of the book is very doubtful. See
Sig. Ab, Cancellieri <i>De Secretariis Veteris Basilicæ Vaticanæ</i>, p.
859, and 2464. Some miniatures of the martyrdom and miracles of St.
George, in another book, are ascribed to him; but I am uncertain whether
there is any ancient document for this; and they might, possibly, be the
work of Simone da Siena, who is often confounded with him.</p>

It was a very ancient practice of Christian worship to place the silver,
or ivory dittici, upon the altars during the service of the mass, and
when the sacred ceremony was over, they were folded up in the manner of
a book, and taken elsewhere. The same figure was retained, even in the
introduction of the largest altar pieces, which likewise consisted of
two wings, and were portable. This custom, of which I have seen few
remnants in Italy, has been long preserved in the Greek church. At
length, by degrees, artists began to paint upon one whole panel. (<i>See
Buonarroti Vetri Antichi</i>, p. 258, &amp;c.)</p>

I notice this peculiarity, because the histories, either painted or
engraved, belonging to those early times, are apt to perplex us; nor can
they be cleared up without having recourse to books of fiction, which
were, in those less civilized periods, believed. In the acts of our
Saviour, and of the Virgin, it may be useful to consult Gio. Alberto
Fabrizio, in the collection entitled "<i>Codex Apocr. Novi
Testamenti</i>;" in the acts of the apostles and martyrs, it is not so
much their real history, as the legends, either manifestly false or
suspected, as recounted by the Bollandisti, that will throw light upon
the subject.</p>

<p class="p2">It is worthy of remark, that Vasari, in the life of Jacopo
di Casentino, quotes the manuscript records of the society of St. Luke,
afterwards printed by Baldinucci, and mentions fourteen painters who
were formerly its captains, counsellors, or chamberlains; yet he takes
no notice of them in his <i>Lives</i>, and of but very few of the great
number named in that manuscript. The same selection was employed by
Baldinucci, in whose <span class="smcap">Veglia</span> we are informed
that many painters flourished about 1300, the names of whom he has
refused to insert in his anecdotes. It clearly appears from his writings
that he omitted about a hundred, all belonging to that age.<a

class="fnanchor">[61]</a> It is therefore incorrect to say, that <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_052" id="Page_052">[Pg 52]</a></span>those
two historians have commemorated many artists of mediocrity, merely
because they were natives of Florence, an accusation alleged against
them by foreigners. The artists of their country whom they have
transmitted to posterity, are not less worthy of record than those
ancient ones of Venice, of Bologna, and of Lombardy, whom we are
accustomed to praise in their respective schools. Among this number I
include Buffalmacco, the wit whose jests, as recorded in Boccaccio and
Sacchetti, render him more celebrated than his pictures. His real name
was Buonamico di Cristofano. He had been the scholar of Tafi, but by
living long in the time of Giotto, he had an opportunity of correcting
his own style. He displayed a most lively fancy, "and when he chose to
exert himself (which rarely happened) was not inferior to any of his
contemporaries."<a name="fnanchor_62" id="fnanchor_62"></a><a
href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It is unfortunate that his
best works, which were in the Abbey and in Ognisanti, have perished, and
there only remain some less carefully executed at Arezzo and at Pisa.
The best preserved are in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_053"
id="Page_053">[Pg 53]</a></span>the Campo Santo; viz. the Creation of
the World, in which there is a figure of the Deity, five cubits high,
sustaining the mighty frame of the heavens and the elements, and three
other historical pictures of Adam, of his children, and of Noah. A
crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of the Redeemer, may be seen at
the same place. Good symmetry is not to be looked for in them; he knew
but little of design, and he drew his figures by other rules than the
roundness and facility seen in the disciples of Giotto. His heads are
deficient in beauty and variety. The pious women near the cross all have
the same mean and vulgar features, in which the mouths are opened even
to deformity. Some of the heads of the men, especially that of Cain,
possess, however, a physiognomical expression which arrests the eye of
the spectator. The air of nature too in the action, as in the man, who,
full of horror, flies from Mount Calvary, is highly praiseworthy. His
draperies are greatly varied, are distinguished by the difference of
stuffs and linings, and are laboriously ornamented with flowers and with
fringes. Before he was employed in the Campo Santo, he painted in the
church of St. Paul, Ripa d'Arno, where he was associated with one Bruno
di Giovanni, formerly his fellow student, and believed to be the painter
of a St. Ursula in a piece which still exists in the Commenda. Unable to
attain the expression of Buffalmacco, he tried to atone for the defect
by the aid of sentences proceeding from the mouths of his figures, which
expressed what their features <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_054"
id="Page_054">[Pg 54]</a></span>and attitudes were incapable of
explaining, a practice in which he was preceded by Cimabue, and followed
by the eccentric Orcagna and several others. This Bruno, together with
Nello di Dino, was associated with Buffalmacco in the jests contrived
for the simple Calandrino. They all owe their fame to Boccaccio, who
introduces them in the eighth day of his Decamerone; and a similar
favour was conferred by Sacchetti on a Bartolo Gioggi, a house-painter,
whom he introduced into his one hundred and seventieth tale. Giovanni da
Ponte, the scholar of Buffalmacco, had some merit, but he was not at all
solicitous to increase it by his diligence. Some remains of his pictures
exist on the walls of the church of St. Francis, at Arezzo.</p>

<p>I believe that Bernardo Orcagna, who rivalled the fame of
Buffalmacco, proceeded from some old school. He was the son of one
Cione, a sculptor, and his brother Jacopo was of the same profession:
but the other brother, Andrea, surpassed them all; and in himself so far
united the attainments of the three sister arts, that he was by some
reckoned second only to Giotto. He is known among architects for having
introduced the circular arch instead of the acute, as may be seen in the
gallery of the Lanzi, which he built and ornamented with sculpture.
Bernardo taught him the principles of painting. They who have
represented him as the pupil of Angiol Gaddi, do not appear attentive to
dates. In the Strozzi chapel in the church of S. Maria Novella, he and
Bernardo painted Paradise, and over against it the Infernal Regions; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_055" id="Page_055">[Pg
55]</a></span>in the Campo Santo of Pisa, Death and the Judgment were
executed by Andrea, and Hell by Bernardo. The two brothers imitated
Dante in the novel representations which they executed at those places;
and that style was more happily repeated by Andrea in the church of
Santa Croce, where he inserted portraits of his enemies among the
damned, and of his friends among the blessed spirits. These pictures are
the prototypes of similar pictures preserved in S. Petronio, at Bologna,
in the cathedral of Tolentino, in the Badia del Sesto, at Friuli,<a
name="fnanchor_63" id="fnanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63"
class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and some other places, in which hell is
distinguished by abysses and a variety of torments, after the manner of
Dante. Several pictures by Andrea remain, and his name is still on that
in the Strozzi chapel, which is full of figures and of episodes. On the
whole, he discovers fertility of imagination, diligence, and spirit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_056" id="Page_056">[Pg
56]</a></span>equal to any of his contemporaries. In composition he was
less judicious, in attitudes less exact, than the followers of Giotto;
and he yields to them in drawing and in colouring.</p>

<p>The same school produced Marinotto, a nephew of Andrea, and a Tommaso
di Marco, whom I pass over, as well as others of little note, no longer
known by existing works. Bernardo Nello di Gio. Falconi of Pisa merits
consideration. He executed many pictures in that cathedral, and is
supposed to be the same with that Nello di Vanni, who, with other Pisan
artists, painted in the Campo Santo in the fourteenth century. Francesco
Traini, a Florentine, is known as much superior to his master, by a
large picture which is in the church of S. Catherine of Pisa, in which
he has represented St. Thomas Aquinas in his own form, and also in his
beatification. He stands in the middle of the picture, under the
Redeemer, who sheds a glory on the Evangelists and him; and from them
the rays are scattered on a crowd of listeners, composed of clergy,
doctors, bishops, cardinals, and popes. Arius and other innovators are
at the feet of the saint, as if vanquished by his doctrine; and near him
appear Plato and Aristotle, with their volumes open, a circumstance not
to be commended in such a subject. This work exhibits no skill in
grouping, no knowledge of relief, and it abounds in attitudes which are
either too tame, or too constrained; and yet it pleases by a marked
expression in the countenances, an air of the antique in the draperies,
and a certain novelty <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_057"
id="Page_057">[Pg 57]</a></span>in the composition. Let us now pass on
to the followers of Giotto.</p>

<p>The scholars of Giotto have fallen into an error common to the
followers of all illustrious men; in despairing to surpass, they have
only aspired to imitate him with facility. On this account the art did
not advance so quickly as it might otherwise have done, among the
Florentine and other artists of the fourteenth century, who flourished
after Giotto. In the several cities above<ins title="hyphenated in the
original"> </ins>mentioned, Giotto invariably appears superior when seen
in the vicinity of such painters as Cavallini, or Gaddi; and whoever is
acquainted with his style, stands in no need of a prolix account of that
of his followers, which, with a general resemblance to him, is less
grand and less agreeable. Stefano Fiorentino alone is a superior genius
in the opinion of Vasari, according to whose account he greatly excelled
Giotto in every department of painting. He was the son of Catherine, a
daughter of Giotto, and possessed a genius for penetrating into the
difficulties of the art, and an insuperable desire of conquering them.
He first introduced foreshortenings into painting, and if in this he did
not attain his object, he greatly improved the perspective of buildings,
the attitudes, and the variety and expression of the heads. According to
Landino he was called the <i>Ape of Nature</i>, an eulogy of a rude age;
since such animals, in imitating the works of man, always debase them:
but Stefano endeavoured to equal and to embellish those of nature. The
most celebrated of his pictures which <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_058" id="Page_058">[Pg 58]</a></span>were in the <i>Ara
C&oelig;li</i> at Rome, in the church of S. Spirito at Florence, and in
other places, have all perished. As far as I know, his country does not
possess one of his undoubted pictures; unless we mention as such, that
of the Saviour in the Campo Santo of Pisa, which, indeed, is in a
greater manner than the works of this master, but it has been retouched.
A <i>Pietà</i>, by his son and disciple Tommaso, as is believed by some,
exists in S. Remigi at Florence, which strongly partakes of the manner
of Giotto; like his frescos at Assisi. He deserved the name of Giottino,
given him by his fellow citizens, who used to say that the soul of
Giotto had transmigrated, and animated him. Baldinucci alleges that
there was another of the same name, who should not be confounded with
him, and quotes the following inscription from a picture in the Villa
Tolomei, "Dipinse Tommaso di Stefano Fortunatino de' Gucci Tolomei." But
Cinelli, the strenuous opponent of Baldinucci, attributes it, perhaps
justly, to Giottino. This artist left behind him one Lippo, sufficiently
commended by Vasari, but who rather seems to have been an imitator than
a scholar. Giovanni Tossicani of Arezzo, was a disciple of Giottino,
employed in Pisa and over all Tuscany. He painted the St. Philip and St.
James, which still remain on the baptismal font in Arezzo, and were
repaired by Vasari while a young man, who acknowledges that he learned
much from this work, injured as it was. With him perished the best
branch of the stock of Giotto.</p>

<p>Taddeo Gaddi may be considered as the Giulio <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_059" id="Page_059">[Pg 59]</a></span>Romano of Giotto, his
most intimate and highly favoured pupil. Vasari, who saw his frescos and
easel pictures at Florence, in good preservation, prefers him to his
master, in colouring and in delicacy; but the lapse of time at this day
forbids our deciding this point, although several of his pictures
remain, especially in the church of Santa Croce, which are scriptural
histories, much in the manner of Giotto. He discovered more originality
in the chapter house of the Spagnuoli, where he worked in competition
with Memmi.<a name="fnanchor_64" id="fnanchor_64"></a><a
href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> He painted some of the
acts of the Redeemer on the ceiling, and the descent of the Holy Spirit
in the refectory, which is among the finest specimens of art in the
fourteenth century. On one of the walls he painted the Sciences, and
under each some one of its celebrated professors; and demonstrated his
excellence in this species of allegorical painting, which approaches so
nearly to poetry. The brilliance and clearness of his tints are chiefly
conspicuous in that chapter house. The royal gallery contains the taking
down of Christ, the work of his hands, which was formerly at
Orsanmichele, and by some ascribed to Buffalmacco, merely because it was
unascertained. Taddeo flourished beyond the term assigned him by Vasari,
and outlived most of those already named. This may be collected from
Franco Sacchetti, a contemporary writer, who relates in his 136th Tale,
that Andrea Orcagna proposed as a question, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_060" id="Page_060">[Pg 60]</a></span>"who was the greatest
master, setting Giotto out of the question?<ins title="Close quote
missing in the original.">"</ins> Some answered Cimabue, others Stefano,
some Bernardo, and some Buffalmacco. Taddeo Gaddi, who was in the
company, said, "truly these were very able painters, but the art is
decaying every day, &amp;c." He is mentioned up to 1352, and he might
possibly survive several years.</p>

<p>He left at his death several disciples, who became eminent teachers
of painting in Florence, and other places. D. Lorenzo Camaldolese is
mentioned with honour. He instructed pupils in the art; and several old
pictures by him and his scholars are in the monastery of the Angeli. At
that time the fraternity of Camaldulites furnished some miniature
painters, one of whom, named D. Silvestro, ornamented missals, which
still exist, and are amongst the best that Italy possesses. The most
favoured pupils of Taddeo were Giovanni da Milano, whom I shall notice
in the school of Lombardy, and Jacopo di Casentino, who also will find a
place there, together with his imitators. To these two he recommended on
his death-bed his two sons and disciples: Giovanni, who died
prematurely, with a reputation for genius; and Angiolo, who being then
very young, most needed a protector. The latter died, according to
Vasari, at 63 years of age; in 1589, according to the date of
Baldinucci. He did not improve the art in proportion to his abilities,
but contented himself with imitating Giotto and his father, in which he
was astonishingly successful. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_061"
id="Page_061">[Pg 61]</a></span>The church of S. Pancrazio possessed one
picture by him, containing several saints, and some histories from the
Gospel, which may still be seen in the monastery, divided into several
pieces, and coloured in a taste superior to what was then usual. There
is another in the same style in the sacristy of the Conventual friars,
by whom he was employed in the choir of the church, to paint in fresco
the story of the recovery of the Cross, and its transportation in the
time of Heraclius; a work inferior to the others, because much larger,
and to him somewhat new. He afterwards lived at Venice, as a merchant
rather than as a painter; and Baldinucci, who seizes every opportunity
of supporting his hypothesis, says, that if he was not the founder of
that school, he, at least, improved it. But I shall demonstrate, in the
proper place, that the Venetian school was advancing to a modern style,
before Angiolo could have taught in that place; and in the many old
pictures I saw at Venice, I was unable to recal to mind the delicate
style of Angiolo. The Venetians owe to him the education of Stefano da
Verona, whom I shall consider in the second volume; and he gave the
Florentines Cennino Cennini, praised by Vasari as a colourist, of whom
as a writer I shall soon make mention.</p>

<p>In the school of Angiolo Gaddi we may reckon Antonio Veneziano,
concerning whom Vasari and Baldinucci disagree. The former makes him a
Venetian, "who came to Florence to learn painting of Agnolo Gaddi:" the
latter, a systematic writer, as we have seen, asserts that he was born
in Florence, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_062" id="Page_062">[Pg
62]</a></span>and that he obtained the surname of Veneziano, from his
residence and many labours in Venice, on the authority of certain
memoirs in the Strozzi library, which were, perhaps, doubted by himself;
for had they been of high authority, he would not have omitted to
proclaim their antiquity. However this may be, each of them is a little
inconsistent with himself. As they assert that Antonio died of the
plague in 1384, or, according to the correction of their annotators, in
1383, at the age of 74, it follows that he was born many years before
Gaddi, whose disciple, therefore, we cannot easily suppose him. It is
likewise rendered doubtful by his design in the legends of S. Ranieri,<a
name="fnanchor_65" id="fnanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65"
class="fnanchor">[65]</a> which remain in the Campo Santo of Pisa, where
there is a certain facility, care, and caprice in the composition, that
savour of another school. Vasari, moreover, notices a method of painting
in fresco, without ever re-touching it when dry, that would seem to have
been introduced from other parts, different <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_063" id="Page_063">[Pg 63]</a></span>from what was employed
by the Tuscan artists, his competitors, whose paintings, in the time of
the historian, were not in as good a state of preservation as those of
Antonio. In the same place he deposited his portrait, which the
describers of the ducal gallery at Florence pretend still to find in the
chamber of celebrated artists. This portrait is, however, painted in a
manner so modern, that I cannot believe it the work of a painter so
ancient. On this occasion I must observe that there was another Antonio
Veneziano, whom this picture probably represents, and who, about the
year 1500, painted, at Osimo, a picture of St. Francis, in the manner of
that age, and inscribed it with his name. I learned this from the
accomplished Sig. Cav. Aqua, who added, that this name had been erased,
and that of Pietro Perugino inserted, who certainly gains no very great
honour by such substitution.</p>

<p>We learn from history<a name="fnanchor_66" id="fnanchor_66"></a><a
href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> that Antonio educated in
Paolo Uccello, a great artist in perspective; and in Gherardo Starnina,
a master in the gay style, of whom there are yet some remnants, in a
chapel of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_064" id="Page_064">[Pg
64]</a></span>the church of Santa Croce. They are among the last efforts
of the school of Giotto, which succeeding artists abandoned, to adopt a
better manner. One exception occurs in Antonio Vite, who executed some
works in the old style, in Pistoia, his native city, and in Pisa. I may
here observe, that Starnina and Dello Fiorentino shortly after
introduced the new Italian manner in the court of Spain, and returned to
Florence with honour and with affluence. The first remained to enjoy
them in his native country, until the time of his death: the latter
returned back to increase them; and, according to Vasari, he left no
public work in Florence, except an historic design of Isaac, in green
earth, in a cloister of the church of S. Maria Novella: perhaps he ought
to have said, that he left various works, for several are there visible,
all in the same taste, and so rude, as to induce us to reckon him rather
a follower of Buffalmacco than of Giotto. But he excelled in small
pieces; and there was none then living who could more elegantly ornament
cabinets, coffers, the backs of couches, or other household furniture,
with subjects from history and fable.</p>

<p>Among the disciples of Taddeo Gaddi I have named Jacopo del
Casentino, of whom there are some remains in the church of Orsanmichele.
Jacopo taught Spinello Aretino, a man of a most lively fancy, as may be
gathered from some of his pictures in Arezzo, no less than from his
life. He painted also at Florence, and was one of those who had the
honour of ornamenting the Campo Santo <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_065" id="Page_065">[Pg 65]</a></span>of Pisa with historical
paintings. His pictures of the martyrs S. Petito and S. Epiro, are
noticed by Vasari as his best performances. He was, however, inferior to
his competitors by the meanness of his design, and the style of his
colouring, in which green and black are predominant, without being
sufficiently relieved by other colours. The fall of the angels still
remains in S. Angelo at Arezzo, in which Lucifer is represented so
terrible, that it afterwards haunted the dreams of the artist, and,
deranging both his mind and body, hastened his death. Bernardo Daddi was
his scholar; a man less known in his own country than at Florence, where
he executed a picture, seen on the gate of San Giorgio (See Moreni, lib.
v. p. 5.); as was also Parri, the son of Spinello, who modernised his
style somewhat on the manner of Masolino. The latter excelled in the art
of colouring, but he was barbarous in the drawing of his figures, which
he made extravagantly long and bending, in order, as he was used to say,
to give them greater spirit. One may see some remains of them at Arezzo
in S. Domenico, and other places. Lorenzo di Bicci of Florence, another
scholar of Spinello, was the Vasari of his time, for the multiplicity,
celerity, and easy self-complacency, shewn in his labours. The first
cloister of the church of S. Croce retains several specimens, consisting
of the legends of S. Francis; and there is an Assumption on the front,
in which he was assisted by Donatello, while still a young man. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_066" id="Page_066">[Pg
66]</a></span>Perhaps his best work is the fresco, ornamenting the
sanctuary of S. Maria Nuova, built by Martin V. about the year 1418. His
son Neri is reckoned among the last followers of Giotto. He lived but a
short time; he left, in S. Romolo, a picture which would not have
disgraced his father, and which is certainly more carefully executed
than was usual with the latter.</p>

<p>During the fourteenth century, sculpture was cultivated at Pisa by as
many artists as painting was at Florence; but Pisa was not on that
account destitute of painters worthy of being recorded. Vasari mentions
one Vicino, who finished the mosaic begun by Turrita, assisted by Tafi
and Gaddi, and adds, that he was also a painter. Sig. da Morrona says,
that he retained the old style of his school; which was the case with
many others, as appears from several old Madonnas upon panels, both of
anonymous and of ascertained painters. Of this sort is that in the old
church of Tripalle, and that at S. Matthew's in Pisa. On the first is
this inscription, <i>Nerus Nellus de Pisa me pinxit</i>, 1299: on the
second we read, <i>Jacopo di Nicola dipintore detto Gera mi dipinse</i>.
The mode of expression is derived from the
&mu;'&epsilon;&pi;&omicron;&iota;&eta;&sigma;&epsilon; of the Greeks; to
which the old Pisans closely adhered in their paintings, their
sculptures, and their bronzes.<a name="fnanchor_67"
id="fnanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Like the other <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_067"
id="Page_067">[Pg 67]</a></span>Italians they at length reformed their
style, and there, as well as at Florence and Siena, families of painters
arose, in which the fathers were excelled by their sons, and they by
their children. Thus, from Vanni, who flourished in 1300, sprung Turino
di Vanni, who flourished about 1343, and Nello di Vanni, who painted in
the Campo Santo, whose son Bernardo was the disciple of Orcagna, and
furnished many pictures for the palace of the primate. There was also in
that city one Andrea di Lippo, who is noticed in the <i>Academical
Discourse on the literary history of Pisa</i>, in the year 1336; the
same, I believe, with that Andrea <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_068" id="Page_068">[Pg 68]</a></span>da Pisa, mentioned among
the artists that ornamented the cathedral of Orvieto in 1346. A work by
one Giovanni di Niccolo remains in the monastery of S. Martha, and,
perhaps, he painted the fine trittico of the Zelada museum at Rome,
which represents our Saviour with S. Stephen, S. Agatha, and other
saints, and which has this inscription, <i>Jo. de Pisis pinxit</i>. This
is a picture of great labour, by some ascribed to Gio. Balducci; which,
if it was ascertained, would confer honour on that great man, as a
professor of the three sister arts. Towards the end of the century the
power of the Pisans declined, rather from civil discord than from other
misfortunes; till at length the city fell into the hands of the
Florentines in 1406, and lay for a long time prostrate and humbled,
deprived, not only of her artists, but almost of her citizens; and fully
glutted the ancient hatred of her hostile neighbours. She at length rose
again, not, indeed, to command, but to more dignified subjection.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Florentines in the mean time increasing with their
power, they became chiefly solicitous to suit the magnificence of their
capital to the grandeur of the state. Cosmo, at once the father of his
country and of men of genius, gave stability to public affairs. Lorenzo
the Magnificent, and others of the house of Medici, followed, whose
hereditary taste for literature and the fine arts is celebrated in a
multitude of books, and most copiously in the histories written by three
eminent authors, Monsignor Fabroni, the Signor <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_069" id="Page_069">[Pg 69]</a></span>Ab. Galluzzi, and Mr.
Roscoe. Their house was at once a lyceum for philosophers, an arcadia
for poets, and an academy for artists. Dello, Paolo, Masaccio, the two
Peselli, both the Lippi, Benozzo, Sandro, the Ghirlandai, enjoyed the
perpetual patronage of this family, and as constantly rendered it
whatever honour they could bestow. Their pictures are full of portraits,
according to the custom of the times, and continually presented to the
people the likenesses of the Medici, and often represented them with
regal ornaments in their pictures of the Epiphany, as if gradually to
prepare the people to behold the sceptre and royal robe securely
established in that house. The good taste of the Medici was seconded by
that of other citizens, who were then distributed into various
corporations, according to their place of residence and profession, each
of which strove with reciprocal emulation to decorate their houses and
their churches. Besides the desire of public ornament, they were
animated by religion, which, in what relates to divine worship, is so
widely spread, not only among the great, but also among the lower orders
of people, that those have a difficulty in believing who have not beheld
it. Their cathedral, a vast fabric, was already reared for the
ceremonies of religion, and here and there some other churches arose;
these and the more ancient, in emulation of each other, they adorned
with paintings, a luxury unknown to their ancestors, and less common in
the other cities of Italy. This disposition gave rise, after the
conclusion <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_070" id="Page_070">[Pg
70]</a></span>of the century, to that prodigious number of painters
already mentioned; and hence sprang, in the century we now treat of,
that crowd of artists in marble, bronze, and silver, who transferred
pre-eminence in sculpture, the ancient inheritance of the Pisans, to the
people of Florence. The Florentines were desirous of ornamenting the new
cathedral and baptistery, the church of Orsanmichele, and other sacred
places, with statues and basso-<ins title="'rilievos' in the
original">relievos</ins>. These brought forward Donatello, Brunelleschi,
Ghiberti, Filarete, Rossellini, Pollajuoli, and Verrocchio, and produced
those noble works in marble, in bronze, and in silver, which sometimes
appear to have attained the perfection of the art, and to have rivalled
the ancients. The rising generation was instructed in design by those
celebrated men, and the universality of the principles they taught, made
the transition from one art to another easy. The same individuals were
often statuaries, founders in bronze, in gold, lapidaries, painters, or
architects, talents that appear enviable to this age, in which an artist
with difficulty acquires a competent knowledge in a single art. Such was
the course of instruction at Florence in the Studies, and such the
subsequent encouragement without, from which it will not appear
wonderful to the reader that this city was the foremost to attain the
perfection of the art. But let us trace the steps by which it advanced
in Florence, and in the rest of Italy.</p>

<p>The followers of Giotto had now carried painting<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_071" id="Page_071">[Pg 71]</a></span>
beyond the period of its infancy, but it continued to give proofs of its
infant faculties, especially in chiaroscuro, and still more in
perspective. Figures sometimes appeared as if falling or slipping from
the canvass; buildings had not a true point of view; and the art of
foreshortening was yet very rude. Stefano Fiorentino perceived rather
than removed the difficulty; others for the most part sought either to
avoid or to compensate for the deficiency. Pietro della Francesca, whom
we have elsewhere noticed, appears to have been the first who revived
the Grecian practice of rendering geometry subservient to the painter.
He is celebrated by Pascoli,<a name="fnanchor_68"
id="fnanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
and by authors of greater note, as the father of perspective.
Brunelleschi was the first Florentine who saw the method of bringing it
to perfection, "which consisted in drawing it in outline by the help of
intersections;"<a name="fnanchor_69" id="fnanchor_69"></a><a
href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and in this manner he drew
the square of St. John, and other places, with true diminution and with
receding points. He was imitated in mosaic by Benedetto da Maiano, and
in painting by Masaccio, to both of whom he was master. About the same
period Paolo Uccello, having studied under Gio. Manetti, a celebrated
mathematician, applied to it with assiduity; and even so dedicated
himself to the pursuit, that in labouring to excel in this, he never
acquired celebrity in the other branches of painting. He delighted in it
far beyond his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_072" id="Page_072">[Pg
72]</a></span> other studies, and used to say that perspective was the
most pleasant of all; so true is it that novelty is a great source of
enjoyment. He executed no work that did not reflect some new light on
that art, whether it consisted of edifices and colonnades, in which a
great space was represented in a small compass, or of figures
foreshortened with a skill unknown to the followers of Giotto. Some of
his historic pictures of Adam, and of Noah, in which he indulged in his
favourite taste for the novel and whimsical, remain in the cloisters of
S. Maria Novella; and there are also landscapes with trees and animals
so well executed, that he might be called the Bassano of the first age.
He particularly delighted to have birds in his house, from which he
drew, and from thence he obtained his surname of Uccello. In the
cathedral there is a gigantic portrait of Gio. Aguto on horseback,
painted by Paolo in green earth. This was, perhaps, the first attempt
made in painting, which achieved a great deal without appearing too
daring. He produced other specimens at Padua, where he delineated some
figures of giants with green earth in the house of the Vitali. He was
chiefly employed in ornamenting furniture for private individuals; the
triumphs of Petrarch in the royal gallery, painted on small cabinets are
supposed by some good judges to be his.</p>

<p>Masolino da Panicale cultivated the art of chiaroscuro. I believe he
derived advantage from having long dedicated his attention to modelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_073" id="Page_073">[Pg
73]</a></span>and sculpture, a practice which renders relief easy to the
painter, beyond what is generally conceived. Ghiberti had been his
master in this branch, who at this time was unrivalled in design, in
composition, and in giving animation to his figures. Colouring, which he
yet wanted, was taught him by Starnina, and in this also he became a
very celebrated master. Thus uniting in himself the excellences of two
schools, he produced a new style, not indeed exempt from dryness, nor
wholly faultless; but grand, determined, and harmonious, beyond any
former example. The chapel of St. Peter al Carmine, is a remaining
monument of this artist. He there painted the Evangelists, and some acts
of the Saint, as his vocation to the apostleship, the tempest, the
denying of Christ, the miracle performed at Porta Speciosa, and the
Preaching. He was prevented by death from representing other acts of St.
Peter, as for instance, the tribute paid to Cæsar, baptism conferred on
the multitude, the healing of the sick, which several years afterwards
were painted by his scholar Maso di S. Giovanni, a youth who obtained
the surname of Masaccio, from trusting to a precarious subsistence, and
living, as it was said, by chance, while deeply engrossed with the
studies of his profession. This artist was a genius calculated to mark
an era in painting; and Mengs has assigned him the highest place among
those who explored its untried recesses. Vasari informs us that "what
was executed before his time might <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_074" id="Page_074">[Pg 74]</a></span>be called paintings, but
that his pictures seem to live, they are so true and natural;" and in
another place adds, that "no master of that age so nearly approached the
moderns." He had formed the principles of his art on the works of
Ghiberti and Donatello; perspective he acquired from Brunelleschi, and
on going to Rome it cannot be doubted that he improved by the study of
ancient sculpture. He there met with two senior artists, Gentile da
Fabriano, and Vittore Pisanello, upon whom high encomiums, as the first
painter of his time, may be seen in Maffei and elsewhere.<a
name="fnanchor_70" id="fnanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70"
class="fnanchor">[70]</a> They who write thus had either not seen any of
the paintings of Masaccio, or at most only his early productions; such
as the S. Anna in the church of S. Ambrose in Florence, or the chapel of
S. Catherine in S. Clement's at Rome, in which, while still young, he
executed some pictures of the passion of Christ, and legends of S. Anna,
to which may be added a ceiling containing the Evangelists, which are
all that now remain free from retouching. This work is excellent for
that time, but some doubt whether it ought to be ascribed to him; and it
is inferior to his painting in the Carmine, of which we may say with
Pliny, <i>jam perfecta sunt omnia</i>. The positions and foreshortenings
of the figures are diversified and complete beyond those practised by
Paolo Uccello. The air of the heads, says Mengs, is in the style of
Raffaello; the expression is so managed that the mind seems no less
forcibly depicted <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_075"
id="Page_075">[Pg 75]</a></span>than the body. The anatomy of the figure
is marked with truth and judgment. That figure, so highly extolled in
the baptism of S. Peter, which appears shivering with cold, marks, as it
were, an era in the art. The garments, divested of minuteness, present a
few easy folds. The colouring is true, properly varied, delicate, and
surprisingly harmonious; the relief is in the grandest style. This
chapel was not finished by him. He died in 1443, not without suspicion
of poison, and left it still deficient in several pictures, which, after
many years were supplied by the younger Lippi. It became the school of
all the best Florentine artists whom we shall have occasion to notice in
this and the succeeding epoch, of Pietro Perugino, and even of
Raffaello; and it is a curious circumstance, that in the course of many
years, in a city fruitful in genius, ever bent on the promotion of the
art, no one in following the footsteps of Masaccio attained that
eminence which he acquired without a director. Time has defaced other
works of his hand at Florence, equally commended, and especially the
sanctuary of the church del Carmine, of which there is a drawing in the
possession of the learned P. Lettor Fontana Barnabita in Pavia. The
royal gallery has very few of his works. The portrait of a young man,
that seems to breathe, and is estimated at a high price, is in the Pitti
collection.</p>

<p>After Masaccio, two monks distinguished themselves in the Florentine
school. The first was a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_076"
id="Page_076">[Pg 76]</a></span>Dominican friar named F. Giovanni da
Fiesole, or B. Giovanni Angelico. His first employment was that of
ornamenting books with miniatures, an art he learned from an elder
brother, who executed miniatures and other paintings. It is said that he
studied in the chapel of Masaccio, but it is not easy to credit this
when we consider their ages. Their style too betrays a different origin.
The works of the friar discover some traces of the manner of Giotto, in
the posture of the figures and the compensation for deficiencies in the
art, not to mention the drapery which is often folded in long tube-like
forms, and the exquisite diligence in minute particulars common to
miniature painters. Nor did he depart much from this method in the
greatest part of his works, which chiefly consist of scripture pieces of
our Saviour, or the Virgin, in cabinet pictures not unfrequently to be
met with in Florence. The royal gallery possesses several; the most
brilliant and highly finished of which, is the birth of John the
Baptist. The Glory,<a name="fnanchor_71" id="fnanchor_71"></a><a
href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> which is in the church of
S. Mary Magdalen de' Pazzi, from its great size, is among his rarest
productions; and it also ranks with the most beautiful. His chief
excellence consists in the beauty that adorns the countenances of his
saints and angels; and he is truly the Guido of the age, for the
sweetness of his colours, which, though in water, he diluted and blended
in a manner <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_077" id="Page_077">[Pg
77]</a></span>which almost reaches perfection. He was also esteemed one
of the best of his age in works executed in fresco; and he was employed
in the decoration of the cathedral of Orvieto, as well as the palace of
the Vatican itself, where he painted a chapel&mdash;a work much
commended by a number of writers. Vasari enumerates Gentile da Fabriano
among his disciples, but the dates render this impossible; and says the
same of Zanobi Strozzi, a man of noble origin, of whom I do not know
that any certain picture exists in a public collection: I only know
that, treading in the steps of his master, he surpassed the reputation
of a mere amateur. Benozzo Gozzoli, another of his disciples, and an
imitator of Masaccio, raised himself far above the majority of his
contemporaries.</p>

<p>In a few points he even surpassed his model, as in the stupendous
size of his edifices, in the amenity of his landscapes, and in the
brilliancy of his fancy, truly lively, agreeable, and picturesque. In
the Riccardi palace, once a royal residence, there is a chapel in good
preservation, where he executed a Glory, a Nativity, and an Epiphany. He
there painted with a profusion of gold and of drapery, unexampled,
perhaps, in fresco; and with an adherence to nature that exhibits an
image of that age in the portraits, the garments, the accoutrements of
the horses, and in the most minute particulars. He long resided at Pisa,
and died there, where he ought to be studied; for his compositions in
that place are better than those at Florence, and he was <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_078" id="Page_078">[Pg 78]</a></span>there
also more sparing in the use of gold. The portrait of S. Thomas Aquinas
is highly spoken of by Vasari and Richardson; but they especially notice
the pictures from scripture history, with which he ornamented a whole
wing of the Campo Santo, "a most prodigious work, sufficient to appal a
legion of painters;"<a name="fnanchor_72" id="fnanchor_72"></a><a
href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and he finished it within
two years. Here he displayed a talent for composition, an imitation of
nature, a variety in the countenances and attitudes, a colouring juicy,
lively, and clear, and an expression of the passions that places him
next to Masaccio. I can scarcely believe that he painted the whole. In
the Ebriety of Noah, in the Tower of Babel, and in some other pictures,
we discern an attempt at surprising, not to be seen in some others,
where figures sometimes occur that seem dry and laboured; defects which
I am disposed rather to attribute to his coadjutors. Near this great
work a monument is erected to his memory by a grateful city, in the
public name, with an epitaph that commends him as a painter. Time
itself, as if conscious of his merit, has respected this work beyond any
other in the Campo Santo.</p>

<p>The other monk was Filippo Lippi, a Carmelite, a genius of a
different stamp from B. Giovanni. He received his instruction, not from
Masaccio, as Vasari would have it, but from his works. His assiduity in
copying him, makes him sometimes appear a second Masaccio, especially in
small histories. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_079"
id="Page_079">[Pg 79]</a></span>Some of his choicest are in the sacristy
of the church of S. Spirito. In that place, in the Church of S. Ambrose,
and elsewhere, his pictures represent the Virgin surrounded by angels,
with full and handsome countenances, distinguished by a colouring and a
gracefulness peculiarly his own. He delighted in drapery like the neat
folds of a surplice; his tints were very clear but delicate, and often
subdued by a purple hue not common to other painters. He introduced
gigantic proportions in his large frescos in the parish church of Prato;
where his pictures of S. Stephen and the Baptist were, in the opinion of
Vasari, his capital performances. His forsaking the convent, his slavery
in Barbary, his works at Naples, at Padua, and elsewhere, his death,
hastened by poison, administered by the relations of a young lady who
had borne him a natural child, likewise named Filippo Lippi, are
recorded by Vasari. P. della Valle is of opinion that he never
<i>professed</i> any order, but in the register of Carmine, his death is
noticed in the year 1469, and he is there denominated Fra Filippo. He
died at Spoleti when he had nearly completed his large picture for the
cathedral. Lorenzo the Magnificent requested his ashes from the
townsmen, but was refused; on which he caused a handsome monument to be
erected for him, with an inscription by Angelo Poliziano; a circumstance
I mention, to demonstrate the respect paid to the art at that period. F.
Diamante da Prato, the scholar of Lippi, and his assistant in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_080" id="Page_080">[Pg 80]</a></span>his
last work, imitated him well; as likewise did Francesco Pesello, a
Florentine of the same school; his son Pesellino, a short lived artist,
followed him with still greater success. The Epiphany of Francesco,
described by Vasari, in which there is a portrait of Donato Acciaiuoli,
is in the royal gallery. The grado, painted by his son for the
apartments of the novices of S. Croce, is there still: on this last are
the histories of S. Cosma and S. Damian, of S. Anthony, and S. Francis,
denominated by the historian most wonderful productions, and, perhaps,
this is not too much to say when we recollect the period.</p>

<p>About this time other able artists flourished at Florence, who were
obscured by greater names. Of this number was Berto Linaiuolo, whose
pictures in private houses were, for a long time, held in great repute.
They were even ordered by the King of Hungary, and procured him great
fame in that kingdom. Alessio Baldovinetti, of noble extraction, was a
painter particularly diligent and minute, a good worker in mosaic, and
the master of Ghirlandaio. In his picture of the Nativity in the porch
of the Nunziata, and in his other works, the design, rather than the
colouring, may now be said to remain; for the tints have vanished, from
a defect in their composition. To them we may add Verrocchio, a
celebrated statuary, a good designer, and a painter for amusement rather
than by profession. While he painted the Baptism of Christ at S. Salvi,
his scholar, L. da Vinci, then <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_081"
id="Page_081">[Pg 81]</a></span>a youth, finished an angel, in a manner
superior to the figures of his master, who, indignant at his own
inferiority to a boy, never more handled the pencil.</p>

<p>Baldinucci imagines that Andrea del Castagno, a name infamous in
history, was a scholar of Masaccio: he was rather his imitator, in
attitude, relief, and casting of the drapery, than in grace and
colouring. He lived at the time that the secret of painting in oil
(discovered by John Van Eych, or John of Bruges, about 1410),<a
name="fnanchor_73" id="fnanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a> was known in Italy, not only by report, but by
experience of the advantages of this method. Our artists, admiring the
harmony, delicacy, and brilliance, which colours received from this
discovery, sighed to possess the secret. For this purpose, one Antonello
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_082" id="Page_082">[Pg
82]</a></span>da Messina, who had studied at Rome, travelled to
Flanders, and having learned the secret, according to Vasari, from the
inventor, went to Venice, where he communicated it to a friend named
Domenico. After having practised much in his own country, at Loreto,<a
name="fnanchor_74" id="fnanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74"
class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and other parts of the ecclesiastical states,
Domenico came to Florence. There he became the general favourite, and on
that account was envied by Castagna, whose dissembled friendship won him
to impart the secret, and rewarded him by an atrocious assassination,
which he perpetrated, in order that there might be none living to rival
him in the art. The assassin was sufficiently skilful to conceal his
crime, owing to which a number of innocent persons soon fell under
suspicion, which did not induce the real criminal to avow the atrocious
deed, until he lay upon his death-bed, when he disclosed his guilt and
did justice to the innocence of others. He had the reputation of being
the first artist of his time, for vigour, for design, and for
perspective, having perfected the art of foreshortening. His finest
works have perished: one of his pictures remains at S. Lucia de'
Magnuoli, and also some of his historic pieces, executed with great
diligence. There is also a Crucifixion, painted on a wall in the
monastery of the Angeli.</p>

<p>Many writers have appeared who deny the above<ins title="hyphenated
in the original"> </ins>mentioned statement of Vasari, and maintain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_083" id="Page_083">[Pg
83]</a></span>that the art of painting in oil was known long before. It
is pretended that it existed in the time of the Romans, an opinion that
is adopted by Sig. Ranza, in regard to a picture <i>said to be of S.
Helena</i>, consisting of a quilting of different pieces of silk
stitched together, exhibiting a picture of the Virgin Saint with the
Infant. The heads and hands are coloured in oils; the drapery is shaded
with the needle, and in a great measure with the pencil. It is preserved
in Vercelli, and from the tradition of its citizens reported by Mabillon
(Diar. Ital. Cap. 28), it is said to be the work of S. Helena, mother of
Constantine; that is, the patches of silk were sewed by her, and the
gilding and painting added to it by her painter, as is conjectured by
Ranza. He was not aware that the practice of drawing the Infant Christ
in the lap of the Virgin (as we notice in the preface to the Roman
school), was posterior to the fourth century; and that other particulars
related by him of the picture cannot belong to the age of Constantine;
for instance, the hooded mantle of our Lady. From such signs we ought
rather to conclude that it is either not an oil painting, or that the
figure, at whatever period executed, has been retouched in the same way
as that of the Nunziata at Florence, or of the Santa Maria Primerana at
Fiesole; the former of which in the drapery, and the latter in the
lineaments, are not the same now as in their ancient state.</p>

<p>Others, without ascending to the first ages of the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_084" id="Page_084">[Pg 84]</a></span>
church, have asserted that oil painting was known out of Italy, at least
as early as the eleventh century. As a proof of this, they adduce a
manuscript of the Monk Teofilo or Ruggiero, no later back than that
period, which bears title, "De omni scientiâ artis pingendi," where
there is a receipt for the preparation and use of oil from flax.<a
name="fnanchor_75" id="fnanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Lessing gave an account of this manuscript in
the year 1774, in a treatise published at Brunswick, where he filled the
office of librarian to the Prince. Morelli, also, in the Codici Naniani
(cod. 39); and more at length Raspe, in his critical "Dissertation on
Oil Painting," published in the English language at London, in which he
enumerated the existing copies in various libraries, and gave a great
part of the manuscript, entered into an examination of the subject.
Lastly, <ins title="'Teofilos's' in the original">Teofilo's</ins>
treatise is inserted by Christiano Leist, in Lessing's collection, "Zur
Geschichte unde Litteratur." Brusw. 1781. The Dottore Aglietti, in his
Giornale Veneto, December, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_085"
id="Page_085">[Pg 85]</a></span>1793, likewise adds his opinion; while
the learned Abbate Morelli, in his "Notizia," which is often cited by me
in the emendation and illustration of this edition, throws the greatest
light upon the present question, agitated by so many, and, we may add,
"rem acu tetigit." He, then, will be found to concede to Giovanni, whom
he calls Gianes da Brugia, the boast of this great discovery, agreeing
with Vasari, though in a different sense from that in which the latter
writer views it. For he does not reply to his opponents, that the art of
painting, as taught by Teofilo, might have gone into disuse, and was
only revived by Giovanni; whence Vasari ventured to commend him as an
original inventor; in the same manner as Tiraboschi replied, who
followed the Roman anthologists (St. Lett. t. vi. p. 1202). Neither does
he bring forward the defence advanced by the Baron de Budberg in the
apology of Gio. da Bruges,<a name="fnanchor_76" id="fnanchor_76"></a><a
href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> to the purport that
Teofilo taught the art of painting in oil, only upon a ground, without
figures, and without ornaments: because Teofilo, in chap. 22, whose
words we have given in the note, likewise taught this art. Into what,
then, does the long-boasted invention of Giovanni resolve itself?
Nothing more than this: according to the ancient practice, a fresh
colour was never added to the panel until the first covering had been
dried in the sun: a mode, as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_086"
id="Page_086">[Pg 86]</a></span>Teofilo confesses, infinitely tedious:
"quod in imaginibus diuturnum et tædiosum nimis est;" (cap. 23); to
which I may add, that the colours in this way could never perfectly
harmonize. Van Eych saw this difficulty, and he became more truly
sensible of it, from the circumstance of having exposed one of his
paintings to the sun, in order to harden, when the excess of heat split
the panel. Being at that period sufficiently skilled both in
philosophical and philological inquiries, he began to speculate on the
manner of applying oils, and of their acquiring a proper consistency
without the aid of the sun. "By uniting it with other mixtures he next
produced a varnish, which, dried, was water proof, and gave a clearness
and brilliancy, while it added to the harmony of his colours." Such are
the words of Vasari; and thus, in a very few words, we may arrive at a
satisfactory solution of the question. Before the time of Van Eych, some
sort of method of painting in oil was known, but so extremely tedious
and imperfect, as to be scarcely applicable to the production of figure
pieces. It was practised beyond the Alps, but is not known to have been
in use in Italy. Giovanni carried the first discovery to its completion;
he perfected the art, which was afterwards diffused over all Europe, and
introduced into Italy, by means of Antonio, or Antonello da Messina.</p>

<p>Here again we are met by another class of objectors, who enter the
lists against Van Eych, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_087"
id="Page_087">[Pg 87]</a></span>against Antonello, and more decidedly
against Vasari, not with arguments from books, but in the strength of
pictorial skill, and chemical experiments.</p>

<p>Malvasia, upon the authority of Tiarini, maintains, that Lippo
Dalmasio painted in oil; the Neapolitans, relying upon Marco da Siena,
and other men of skill, assert the same of their artists in the
thirteenth century; while a few have pretended that some of the
pictures<a name="fnanchor_77" id="fnanchor_77"></a><a
href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> produced in the fourteenth
century, to be seen at Siena and Modena, in particular that from the
hand of Tommaso da Modena, belonging to the Imperial cabinet, and
described by me in the native school of that artist, are also coloured
in oil; because, after being exposed to water, and analyzed, the colours
discovered their elements, and were pronounced oil. In spite, however,
of so much skill, and so many experiments, I cannot see that Vasari has
yet been detected in an error. It would not be difficult to oppose other
experiments and opinions, that might throw light upon the question. To
begin with Tuscany:&mdash;an analysis of several Tuscan paintings was
made at Pisa by the very able chemist Bianchi; <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_088" id="Page_088">[Pg 88]</a></span>and though apparently
coloured in oil, the most lucid parts were found to give out particles
of wax; a material employed in the <i>encausti</i>, and not forgotten by
the Greeks, who instructed Giunta and his contemporaries. It would
appear that they applied it as a varnish, to act as a covering and
protection from humidity, as well as to give a lucid hue and polish to
the colours. It has been observed, that the proportion of wax employed
greatly decreased during the fourteenth century; and after the year 1360
fell into disuse, and was succeeded by a vehicle, that carries no gloss.
But in these experiments oil was never elicited, if we except a few
drops of essential oil, which the learned professor conjectures was
employed at that early period to dissolve the wax made use of in
painting.</p>

<p>Besides this material, certain gums, and yolks of eggs, which easily
deceive the eye of the less skilful, were also used, and very nearly
resemble those pictures that display a scanty portion of oil, as is
observed by Zanetti, in his account of Venetian painting (p. 20); and
the analysis of Tommaso da Modena's picture has tended to confirm his
opinion. This information I owe to the late Count Durazzo, who, in 1793,
assured me, when at Venice, that he had himself beheld, at Vienna, the
process of analyzing such pictures, by very skilful hands, at the
command, and in the presence of Prince Kaunitz; and that it was the
unanimous opinion of those professors, that no traces of oil were to be
found. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_089" id="Page_089">[Pg
89]</a></span>The colours consisted of the finest gums, mixed with the
yolk and white of eggs, a fact that afforded just ground for a like
conclusion in regard to similar works by the ancients. I fully
appreciate, likewise, the opinion of Piacenza upon the celebrated
picture of Colantonio; this I reserve, however, together with some
further reflections of my own, for the school of Naples.</p>

<p>I shall here merely inform the reader, that, in regard to the
chemical experiments employed on these paintings, Sig. da Morrona<a
name="fnanchor_78" id="fnanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78"
class="fnanchor">[78]</a> observes, that old pictures are often believed
to be in a state of purity, when they have been retouched with oil
colours at a subsequent period: the use of wax, and of essential oils,
or of some such old methods, may frequently give rise to doubt, as I
shall soon shew.</p>

<p>Having removed the objections brought against the opinion of Vasari,
I must add a few words in regard to a passage where he seems to have
forgotten what he had said in the life of Angiol Gaddi, but which will
in fact throw further light upon the question. He is giving an account
of the paintings and writings of Andrea Cennini, a scholar of Angelo.
This person, in 1437, that is, long before the arrival of Domenico,
composed a work on painting, which is preserved in MS. in the library of
S. Lorenzo. He there treated, says Vasari, of grinding colours with oil,
for making red, blue, and green grounds; and <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_090" id="Page_090">[Pg 90]</a></span>various new methods and
sizes for gilding, but not figures. Baldinucci examined the same
manuscript, and found these words in the 89th chapter:&mdash;"I wish to
teach thee how to paint in oil on walls, or on panel, as practised by
many Germans;" and on consulting the manuscript, I find, after that
passage, "and by the same method on iron and on marble; but I shall
first treat of painting on walls." In the succeeding chapters he says,
that this must be accomplished "by boiling linseed oil." This appears
not to accord with the assertion of Vasari, that John of Bruges, after
many experiments, "discovered that linseed oil and nut oil were the most
drying. When boiled with his other ingredients they formed the varnish
so long sought after by him and all other painters." On weighing the
evidence, we should, in my opinion, take three circumstances into
consideration: The first is, that Vasari does not deny that oil was
employed in painting; since he affirms that it was long a desideratum,
and consequently had been often attempted; but that alone is perfect
which, "when dry, resists water; which brightens the colours, makes them
clear, and perfectly unites them." 2. The oil of Cennini might not be of
this sort, either because it was not boiled with the ingredients of Van
Eych, or because it was intended only for coarse work; a circumstance
rendered probable by the fact, that though he painted the Virgin, with
several Saints, in the hospital of Bonifazio, at Florence, "in a good
style of colouring," yet he never<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_091" id="Page_091">[Pg 91]</a></span> excited the admiration
nor the envy of artists. 3. The above remarks forbid us to give implicit
confidence to every relation that is given of ancient oil pictures; but
we are not blindly to reject all accounts of imperfect attempts of that
nature. After this digression we return to our narrative.</p>

<p>The painters that remain to be noticed, approach the golden age of
the art, of which their works in some degree participate,
notwithstanding the dryness of their design, and the general want of
harmony in their colouring. The vehicle of their colours was commonly
water, very rarely oil. They flourished in the time of Sixtus IV., who,
having erected the magnificent chapel that retains his name, invited
them from Florence. Their names are Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Rosselli,
Luca da Cortona, and D. Bartolommeo d'Arezzo; whom I shall here
introduce, together with their followers. Manni, the historian of some
of these artists,<a name="fnanchor_79" id="fnanchor_79"></a><a
href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> conjectures that this work
was executed about the year 1474. They were desired to pourtray the
history of Moses on one part of the chapel, and that of Christ on the
other: thus the old law was confronted by the new, the shade by the
light, and the type by the person typified. The pontiff was unskilled in
the fine arts, but covetous of the glory they confer on the name and
actions of princes. To superintend the work, he made choice of Sandro
Filipepi, from his first master, a goldsmith, surnamed Botticelli, and
the pupil of F. Filippo; a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_092"
id="Page_092">[Pg 92]</a></span>celebrated artist at that time, and
distinguished by his pictures containing a great number of small figures
in which he strongly resembled Andrea Mantegna; though his heads were
less beautiful. Vasari says, that his little picture of the Calumny of
Apelles, is as fine a production as possible, and he pronounces the
Assumption, painted for the church of S. Pier Maggiore, to be so
excellent, that it ought to silence envy. The former is in the royal
gallery, the latter in a private house. What he painted in the Sistine
Chapel, however, surpasses all his other works. Here we scarcely
recognize Sandro of Florence. The Temptation of Christ, embellished with
a magnificent temple, and a <ins title="'croud' in the
original">crowd</ins> of devotees in the vestibule; Moses assisting the
daughters of Jethro against the Midianite shepherds, in which there is
great richness of drapery, coloured in a new manner; and other subjects,
treated with vigour and originality, exhibit him in this place greatly
superior to his usual manner. The same observation applies to the
painters we are about to notice: such were the effects produced by their
emulation; by the sight of a city that is calculated to enlarge the
ideas of those who visit it, and by the judgment of a public that is
scarcely to be satisfied by what is above mediocrity, because its eye is
habituated to what is wonderful.</p>

<p>History does not point out the portion of this work that was
performed by Filippino Lippi; the son, as we have already observed, of
F. Filippo. It is however highly probable that he assisted; because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_093" id="Page_093">[Pg
93]</a></span>he was his father's pupil from a very early age, and
because the taste of Lippi, that delighted in portraying the usages of
antiquity in his pictures, appears to have been formed while he was
still young, and engaged in his studies at Rome. In the life which
Cellini has written of himself, he tells us that he had seen several
books of antiquities drawn by Lippi; and Vasari gives him credit for
being the first who decorated modern paintings by the introduction of
grotesques, trophies, armour, vases, edifices and drapery, copied from
the models of antiquity; but this I cannot confirm, because it was
before attempted by Squarcione. It is true that he excelled in those
ornaments, in his landscape and in minute particulars. The S. Bernard of
the Abbey, the Magi of the royal museum, and the two frescos in S. Maria
Novella; the one the history of S. John, the other of S. Philip, the
apostles, please more perhaps by these accessaries of the art than by
the countenances, which, indeed, have not the beauty and grace of the
elder Lippi. They are faithful portraits, but shew no discrimination. He
was invited to Rome to ornament a chapel of the Minerva, in which there
is an Assumption by his hand, and some histories of Thomas Aquinas,
amongst which the Disputation is the best. In this chapel he shews great
improvement in his heads, but was nevertheless surpassed in this respect
by his pupil Raffaellino del Garbo, who painted a choir of angels on the
ceiling, that would alone suffice to justify the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_094" id="Page_094">[Pg 94]</a></span> name by which he was
distinguished. In Monte Oliveto at Florence, there is a Resurrection by
Raffaellino, where the figures are small, but so graceful withal, so
correct in attitude, and so finely coloured, that we can scarcely rank
him inferior to any master of that age. There is mention made by the
learned Moreni, in the concluding part of his "Memorie Istoriche," (p.
168) of another of his beautiful altar-pieces, still in existence at S.
Salvi, with the grado entire. Some early pictures are in a similar
state; but becoming the father of a numerous family, he gradually
degenerated in his style, and died in poverty and obscurity.</p>

<p>The second whom I have mentioned among the artists in the Sistine
Chapel, is Domenico Corradi, surnamed Del Ghirlandaio, from the
profession of his father.<a name="fnanchor_80" id="fnanchor_80"></a><a
href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> He was a painter, an
excellent worker in mosaic, and even contributed to the improvement of
these arts. He painted in the Sistine Chapel the Resurrection of Christ,
which has perished; and the Call of S. Peter and S. Andrew, which still
remains. He is that Ghirlandaio, in whose school, or on whose manner,
not only Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, his son, but also Bonarruoti, and the
best artists of the succeeding era, formed their style. He possessed
clearness and purity of outline, correctness of form, and variety of
ideas, together with facility and uncommon diligence; he <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_095" id="Page_095">[Pg 95]</a></span>was
the first Florentine, who, by means of true perspective, attained a
happy method of grouping, and depth of composition.<a name="fnanchor_81"
id="fnanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> He
was among the first to reject the deep golden fringes to the drapery,
that the old masters introduced; who, unable to render their figures
beautiful, endeavoured, at least, to make them gaudy. Some of his
pictures, however, yet remain, moderately illuminated with gold; as for
instance, the Epiphany in the church of the Innocents at Florence. It is
a fine work, as is also his chapel in the Holy Trinity, with the actions
of S. Francis, and his Nativity, in the sacristy of that church. His
most celebrated work is the choir of S. Maria Novella, on one side of
which he designed the history of John the Baptist, on the other that of
our Lady, and on another part the murder of the Innocents, so much
commended by Vasari. It contains a vast many portraits of literary men,
and noble citizens, and almost every head is from the life; but they are
dignified, and judiciously selected. The hands and feet of the figures,
however, do not correspond, and attention to this circumstance is the
peculiar merit of Andrea del Sarto, who seems to have carried the manner
of Ghirlandaio to perfection. Many works of the latter are scattered
over Italy, in Rome, in Rimini, and at Pisa, at the Eremitani di Pietra
Santa, and the Camaldolesi of Volterra; where besides the paintings in
the refectory, there is in the church a figure of S. Romualdo,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_096" id="Page_096">[Pg 96]</a></span>
carved by Diana of Mantua. The pictures of this master should not be
confounded with those of his scholars, as happens in many instances.
Thus the holy families painted by his brothers or his scholars,
frequently pass for his; but they are very far from meriting the praise
we have justly bestowed on him. Davide, one of his brothers, became very
eminent in mosaic; another, Benedetto, painted more in France than in
Italy; Bastiano Mainardi, their brother-in-law, was rather the assistant
of Domenico, than a painter of originality. Baldino Bandinelli, Niccolo
Cieco, Jacopo del Tedesco, and Jacopo Indaco, are little known; except
that the last is recorded as having assisted with Pinturicchio, at Rome,
and was the brother of Francesco, better known as a painter at
Montepulciano than in Florence.</p>

<p>Cosimo Rosselli, whose noble family has produced several other
artists, also wrought in the Sistine Chapel. Few of his works remain in
public places in his own country, besides the miracle of the sacrament
in the church of S. Ambrose, a fresco picture, full of portraits; in
which we discover variety, character, and truth. Vasari praises his
labours at Rome, less than those of his fellow artists. Being unable to
rival his competitors in design, he loaded his pictures with brilliant
colours and gilded ornaments, which, though it was at that time
condemned by an improving taste, yet pleased the pontiff, who commended
and rewarded him beyond all the other artists. Perhaps his best work
there, is Christ <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_097"
id="Page_097">[Pg 97]</a></span>preaching on the mount, in which the
landscape is said to be the work of Pier di Cosimo, a painter likewise
more remarkable for his colouring than his design; as is evident from a
picture in the church of the Innocents, and his Perseus in the royal
gallery. They are both, however, celebrated in history; the one as the
master of del Porta, the other of Andrea del Sarto.</p>

<p>No other Florentine was employed to paint in the Sistine Chapel; but
Piero and Antonio Pollaiuoli, who were both statuaries and painters,
came there not long afterwards and wrought in bronze the tomb of Sixtus
IV. Some of their paintings may yet be seen in the church of S. Miniato,
without the walls of Florence, and the altar-piece was transferred to
the royal museum. We may there trace the school of Castagno, the master
of Piero, in the harsh features, coloured in a strong and juicy manner.
Antonio, the scholar of Piero, became one of the best painters of that
age. In the chapel of the Marchesi Pucci, at the church of St.
Sebastiano de' Servi, there is a martyrdom of the saint by him, which is
one of the best pictures of the fifteenth century I have ever seen. The
colouring is not in the best style; but the composition rises above the
age in which he lived, and the drawing of the naked figure shews what
attention he had bestowed on anatomy. He was the first Italian painter
who dissected bodies in order to learn the true situations of the
tendons and muscles. Both the Pollaiuoli died at Rome, where <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_098" id="Page_098">[Pg 98]</a></span>their
tomb is to be seen in S. Piero in Vincoli, ornamented with a picture,
which, according to some, typifies a soul in purgatory, and the efficacy
of indulgences to deliver it; but whether it is by them, or of their
school, I am unable to determine.</p>

<p>The two following artists were brought to the Sistine Chapel from the
Florentine territory, the painters of which I shall now consider after
those of the capital. Luca Signorelli, the kinsman of Vasari of Arezzo,
and the disciple of Piero della Francesca, was a spirited and expressive
painter, and one of the first Tuscan artists who designed figures with a
true knowledge of anatomy, though somewhat dryly. The cathedral of
Orvieto evinces this; and those naked figures which even Michelangiolo
has not disdained to imitate. Although in most of his works we do not
discover a proper choice of form, nor a sufficient harmony of colouring
in some of them, especially in the communion of the Apostles, painted
for the Jesuits in his native city, there is beauty, grace, and tints
approaching to modern excellence. He painted in Urbino, at Volterra,
Florence, and many other cities. In the Sistine Chapel he painted the
Journey of Moses with Sefora, and the Promulgation of the Old Law,
paintings full of incident, and superior in composition to the confused
style of that age. Vasari and Taia have assigned him the first place in
this great assemblage of artists; to me he seems at least to have
equalled the best of them, and to have improved on his usual style. He
had two countrymen of noble families for pupils;<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_099" id="Page_099">[Pg 99]</a></span> Tommaso Bernabei, who
followed him closely, and has left some works in S. M. del Calcinaio,
and Turpino Zaccagna, whose style was different, as appears from a
picture painted for the Church of S. Agatha in Cantalena near Cortona,
in 1537.</p>

<p>Don Bartolommeo della Gatta executed none of his own designs in the
Sistine Chapel; he lent assistance to Signorelli and to Perugino. He had
been educated in the monastery of the Angeli, at Florence, rather as a
painter of miniatures than of history. On being appointed Abbot of S.
Clement, in Arezzo, he exercised both; and was also skilled in music and
in architecture. There is of his works only a S. Jerome, executed in the
chapel of the cathedral, as we find from a MS. guide to the city, and
which was transferred into the sacristy in 1794. The abbot instructed
Domenico Pecori and Matteo Lappoli, two gentlemen of Arezzo, who
improved themselves in the art on other models, especially the first, as
is evident from a picture in the parish church, in which the Virgin
receives under her mantle the people of Arezzo, who are recommended to
her protection by their patron saints. In it are heads in the style of
Francia, good architecture, judicious composition, and a moderate use of
gold.</p>

<p>Two miniature painters, according to Vasari, learned much from the
precepts, or rather from the example of the abbot. These were Girolamo,
also named by Ridolfi, as a pupil of the Paduan school, at the same time
with Lancilao; and Vante, or as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100"
id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>he subscribed himself, Attavante
Fiorentino. Two of his letters are inserted in the third volume of the
Lettere Pittoriche; and it may be collected from Vasari and
Tiraboschi,<a name="fnanchor_82" id="fnanchor_82"></a><a
href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> that Vante ornamented with
miniatures many books for Matthias, king of Hungary, which afterwards
remained in the Medicean and Estensean libraries. The learned Sig. Ab.
Morelli, who has the direction of the library of S. Mark at Venice,
shewed me one in that place. It is a work of Marziano Capella, where the
subject is poetically expressed by the painter. The assembly of the
Gods, the emblems of the arts and sciences, the grotesque ornaments here
and there set off with little portraits, discover in Vante a genius that
admirably seconded the ideas of the author. The design resembles the
best works of Botticelli; the colouring is gay, lively, and brilliant;
the excellence of the work ought to confer on the artist greater
celebrity than he enjoys. In the life of D. Bartolommeo, Vasari, or his
printers, have confounded Attavante with Gherardo, the miniature
painter, who at the same time was a worker in mosaic, an engraver in the
style of Albert Durer, and a painter; of him there are some remains in
each of these arts; but they were certainly different individuals, as is
demonstrated by Sig. Piacenza.</p>

<p>Having a little before named Pietro Perugino, who long taught in
Tuscany, we may here mention <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101"
id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>the pupils who retained his manner.
These were Rocco Zoppo, whose Madonnas remain in many private houses in
Florence, I believe, to this day, and are in the manner of Pietro;
Baccio Ubertini, a great colourist, and on that account willingly
adopted as an assistant of his master; Francesco, the brother of Baccio,
surnamed Bacchiacca, known at S. Lorenzo by the martyrdom of S.
Arcadius, executed in small figures, in which, as well as in the
grotesque, he was very eminent, and nearly approached the modern style.
To these artists who lived in Florence, their native country, we may add
Niccolo Soggi, likewise a Florentine, but who, to shun the concourse of
more able painters, fixed his residence in Arezzo, where he had
sufficient employment. His accuracy, his studious habits, and his high
finish, may be there contemplated in the Christ in the Manger, in the
church of Madonna delle Lagrime, and in many other places in the city
and its environs. It would have been fortunate had he possessed more
genius, but this gift of nature, which, to use the words of a poet,<a
name="fnanchor_83" id="fnanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a> confers immortality on books, and I would add
pictures, was not granted to Soggi. Vasari has given this character of a
diligent, but meagre, and frigid painter, also to Gerino da Pistoia, in
which place one of his pictures, now in the royal gallery, was painted
for the monks of S. Pier Maggiore; several others are in the city of S.
Sepulcro, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg
102]</a></span>some even in Rome, where he assisted Pinturicchio. With
the two preceding, I class Montevarchi, a painter so named from his own
country, beyond which he is almost unknown. Among these artists, though
they were scholars of Pietro, we find imitators of the Florentines of
the fourteenth century. I omit the name of Bastiano da S. Gallo, who
continued with him only a short time, and left him on account of the
aversion he had conceived to the dryness of his style. In the Florentine
history, by Varchi (book 10), we find mention of a Vittorio di
Buonaccorso Ghiberti, who on occasion of the siege of Florence by the
family of the Medici, in 1529, painted the figure of the Pontiff,
Clement VII. on the façade of the principal chamber of the Medici, in
the last act of hanging from the gallows. But neither of this, nor of
any other production from so infamous a hand, do there remain any traces
in Florence, at least that I have been able to discover, from which to
judge either of the manner or the master of Vittorio.</p>

<p>I close the catalogue of old Tuscan painters with an illustrious
native of Lucca, named the elder Zacchia, who was educated at Florence,
though not invariably adhering to the taste of that ancient school,
either in design, which was his chief excellence, or in an outline
somewhat harsh and cutting, which was his greatest defect. He obtained
the name of the elder, to distinguish him from another Zacchia, who, on
the other hand, shewed more softness of contour, and more strength of
colouring, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg
103]</a></span>but in design, and in every other respect, was held in
less estimation. I know only of one picture by the latter artist, which
is in the chapel of the Magistrates; but several altar-pieces by the
former, are to be seen in the churches of Lucca, and among them an
Assumption in that of S. Augustine; a picture displaying much study and
elegance, and among his last works, as I am led to believe by its
bearing the date 1527. One of his Madonnas, surrounded by saints,
formerly in the parish church of S. Stefano, is now in the house of Sig.
March. Jacopo Sardini, which is enriched by other paintings, by a
valuable collection of drawings, and still more by the presence of its
learned possessor, to whom I am indebted for many notices interspersed
throughout this work.</p>

<p>Such was the state of the art in Tuscany, about the beginning of the
sixteenth century. Much was then attained, because nature began to be
imitated, especially in the heads, to which the artists imparted a
vivacity, that even at this day is surprising. On viewing the figures
and portraits of those times, they actually appear to look at, and to
desire to enter into conversation with the beholder. It still remained,
however, to give ideal beauty to the figure, fulness to design, and
harmony to colouring, a true method to aerial perspective, variety to
composition, and freedom to the pencil, which on the whole was still
timid. Every circumstance conspired to this melioration of the art in
Florence as well as in other places. The taste <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>for magnificent
edifices had revived throughout Italy. Many of the finest churches, many
public edifices, and ducal palaces, which still remain at Milan, Mantua,
and Venice, in Urbino, Rimini, Pesaro, and Ferrara, were executed about
this period; not to mention those buildings in Florence and in Rome,
where magnificence contended with elegance. It became necessary to
ornament them, and this produced that noble emulation among artists,
that grand fermentation of ideas, which invariably advances the progress
of art. The study of poetry, so analogous to that of painting, had
increased to a degree which conferred on the whole age the epithet of
<i>Golden</i>; a name which it certainly did not merit on the score of
more severe studies. The design of the artists of that period, though
something dry, was yet pure and correct, and afforded the best
instruction to the succeeding age. It is very justly observed, that
scholars can more easily give a certain fulness to the meagre outline of
their models, than curtail the superfluity of a heavy contour. On this
account, some professors of the art are inclined to believe, that it
would be much more advantageous to habituate students in the beginning,
to the precision characteristic of the fifteenth century, than to the
exuberance introduced in after-times. Such circumstances produced the
happiest era that distinguishes the annals of painting. The schools of
Italy, owing to mutual imitation, before that period strongly resembled
each other; but having then attained <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>maturity, each began to
display a marked and peculiar character.</p>

<p>That of the Florentine school I shall describe in the next Epoch; but
I first propose to treat of several other arts analogous to that of
painting, and in particular of engraving upon copper, the discovery of
which is ascribed to Florence. To this the art is indebted for an
accession of new aids; the work of an artist, before confined to a
single spot, was diffused through the world, and gratified the eyes of
thousands.</p>

"The number of artists of whom, by consulting old authors, I can collect
nothing more than the time they lived, their name and occupation, and
their death, (I speak of those who lived about the year 1300,) amounts
in the city of Florence alone to nearly a hundred, without including
those who have been discovered and noticed by some of our antiquarians;
and exclusive of those we find mentioned in the old book of the Society
of Painters." (See Baldinucci in Notizie del Gioggi.) The Florentine
painters of this age, whose names have been produced by the Canon Moreni
from the records of the diplomatic archive, may be seen in part the
fourth of his <i>Notizie Istoriche</i>, p. 102. Others have been
collected and communicated to me by the Abbate Vincenzo Follini,
Librarian to the Magliabecchi collection, extracted from various MSS. of
the same, besides those from the <i>Novelle Litterarie</i> of Florence,
from the <i>Delizie de' Letter.</i> of the P. Ildefonso, C. S. and from
the <i>Viaggi</i> of Targioni; works which will always be found to
supply the brevity of the present history.</p>

They are believed to be anterior to the year 1300 by the historian of
the art of Painting at Friuli; but to this I cannot agree. The pictures
bear a very great resemblance to the designs of Orcagna; or rather to
the poetry of Dante, who, in the year above<ins title="hyphenated in the
original"> </ins>mentioned, feigns to have had his vision, and described
it in the years immediately succeeding. In confirmation of this opinion,
it must be remarked that the style is Florentine, and induces us to
suppose that a painter of that school must have been there. See
<i>Lettera postuma del P. Cortinovis sopra le Antichità di Sesto</i>,
published in the <i>Giornale Veneto</i>, (or <i>Memorie per servire all'
Istoria Letter. e Civile</i>) Semestre ii. p. 1. of the year 1800. It
was reprinted at Udine in 1801, in octavo, with some excellent notes by
the Cav. Antonio Bartolini, who has distinguished himself by other
productions connected with bibliography and the fine arts.</p>

Vasari is by no means so bitter against the Venetian school as it is
wished to make him appear. In regard to these pictures he declares,
"that they are universally admitted, with justice, to be the best which
were produced among many excellent masters, at different times, in that
place." They are, therefore, preferred by him to the whole of the
Florentine and Siennese paintings there exhibited; and his opinion is
authorized by that of P. della Valle, who frequently differs from him.
If it could be proved from history, as it may be reasonably conjectured,
that Antonio was a painter when he came from Venice, and did not
commence his art at Florence, he would merit the reputation of being the
greatest artist of that school known to us; as well as of having
conferred some benefit upon that of Florence, from the Venetian school.
But this point is very doubtful.</p>

<p class="footnote">

<a href="#fnanchor_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a>
We cannot reconcile it to dates that Paolo Uccello was one of his
scholars, having been born after the death of Antonio, if, indeed, there
be not some error in regard to the chronology either of the master or of
his pupil. Starnina might have been his pupil, as he is said to have
been born in 1354; and, therefore, in 1370, he might possibly be one of
his school. Yet it appears that Antonio had then renounced the easel. In
his epitaph we find written:</p>

The old painters varied the manner of their superscriptions, even in the
following ages, according to the taste of the Greeks. <i>Sebastianus
Venetus pingebat a.</i> 1520; is written upon a St. Agatha in the
Palazzo Pitti; and this corresponds to the
&#917;&#928;&#927;&#921;&#917;&#921;, <i>faciebat</i>; by which the
Greek sculptors wished to convey, that such work was not intended to
exhibit their last effort; so that they were at liberty to improve it
when they pleased. The subscription of Opus Belli is obvious, and
similar ones, drawn from the &#917;&#929;&#915;&#927;&#925;, (for
example,) &#923;&#933;&#931;&#929;&#929;&#927;&#933; which we see in
Maffei. I recount in my fifth book as singular, the epigraph <i>Sumus
Rogerii manus</i>; it is, however, derived from the Greeks, who, for
instance, sometimes wrote &#935;&#917;&#921;&#929;.
&#913;&#924;&#914;&#929;&#927;&#931;&#921;&#927;&#933;.
&#924;&#927;&#925;&#913;&#935;&#927;&#933;, as I read in a Fabrianese
church called Della Carità, where there is a picture of the General
Judgment; the figures very small, and highly finished, upon a large
tablet; with, I think, more figures than are seen in the Paradise of
Tintoretto. &#935;&#917;&#921;&#929;
&#914;&#921;&#932;&#927;&#929;&#917;, was written by Vittor Carpaccio,
under his portrait cited in the index. I omit other forms better known.
That adopted at Trevigi, <i>Hieronymus Tarvisio</i>, is very erudite;
and it is imitated from the military <i>latercoli</i>, in which, with
the same view, the soldier and his country are named. In short, where
the words <i>fecit</i> or <i>pinxit</i> are not used, the best plan was
that of giving the proper name in the genitive case at the foot of the
picture, as the engravers of Greek gems were wont to do in inscriptions,
as &#913;&#933;&#923;&#927;&#933;
&#916;&#921;&#927;&#931;&#922;&#927;&#929;&#921;&#916;&#927;&#933;,

In the dictionary of Guarienti, in the article, Gio. Abeyk, appears an
account of a picture of this artist, existing in the gallery at Dresden,
bearing date 1416; a time, says the writer, when he enjoyed his highest
reputation, by painting in his second manner, in oil. It represents the
Virgin in a majestic seat with the divine infant, who is seen very
gracefully receiving an apple from St. Anne, seated on a couch of straw.
The young St. John is seen assisting, and also St. Joseph, whose
countenance represents the portrait of the painter himself. The
introduction of arms shews that the picture must have been executed for
some distinguished person. It is in high preservation, and is pronounced
by Guarienti the miracle of painting, from its display of extreme
diligence, even in the minute furniture, and particularly because the
chamber in which the scene is represented, the couch, the window, the
pavement, executed <i>a punto alto</i>, together with the whole action,
are conducted with the most exact rules of perspective.</p>

<h4>EPOCH I.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Origin and progress of Engraving on Copper and
Wood.</i></div>

<h4>SECTION III.</h4>

<p class="p2">The subject of which I propose here to treat, ought to be
more carefully examined than any other portion of this work. The age in
which I write is, we know, by many called the age of brass, inasmuch as
it has been less productive of great names and great pictoric works,
than the preceding; yet I believe we might better denominate it such
from the number of engravings, which have recently been carried to a
high degree of excellence. The number of their connoisseurs has
increased beyond calculation; new collections every where appear, and
the prices have proportionably advanced, while treatises upon the art
are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg
106]</a></span>rapidly multiplied. It has become a part of liberal
knowledge to discern the name and hand of a master, as well as to
specify the most beautiful works of each engraver. Thus, during the
decline of painting, the art of engraving on copper has risen in
estimation; modern artists in some points equal or surpass the more
ancient; their reputation, their remuneration, and the quick process of
their labours, attract the regard of many men of genius born to adorn
the arts, who to the loss of painting, devote their attention to the
graver.</p>

<p>The origin of this art is to be sought for in that of cutting on
wood, just as in printing, the use of wooden types led to the adoption
of metal. The period of the first invention of wood engraving is
unknown; the French and the Germans tracing it to that of playing-cards,
which the former affirm were first used in France in the time of Charles
V.; while the latter maintain they were in use much earlier in Germany,
or before the year 1300.<a name="fnanchor_84" id="fnanchor_84"></a><a
href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Both these opinions were
first attacked by Papillon, in his "Treatise upon cutting in Wood,"
where he claims the merit of the discovery for Italy, and finds the most
ancient traces of the art about the year 1285, at Ravenna. His account
of it is republished in the preface to the fifth volume of Vasari,
printed at Siena; but it is mixed up with so <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>many assertions, to
which it is difficult to give credit, that I must decline considering it
at all. The Cav. Tiraboschi is a far more plausible and judicious
advocate in favour of Italy.<a name="fnanchor_85"
id="fnanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> On
the subject of cards, he brings forward a MS. by Sandro di Pippozzo di
Sandro, entitled <i>Trattato del Governo della Famiglia</i>. It was
written in 1299, and has been cited by the authors of the Della Cruscan
dictionary, who quote, among other passages, the following words: "if
you will play for money, or thus, or at cards, you shall provide them,"
&amp;c. We may hence infer, that playing-cards were known with us
earlier than elsewhere, so that if the invention of stamping upon wood
was derived from them, we have a just title to the discovery. In all
probability, however, it does not date its origin so early; the oldest
playing-cards were doubtless the work of the pen, and coloured by the
old illuminators, first practised in France, and not wholly extinct in
Italy at the time of Filippo Maria Visconti, duke of Milan.<a
name="fnanchor_86" id="fnanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86"
class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The first indication we meet with of printed play-cards, is in a
public decree issued at Venice in 1441; where it says that "the art and
trade of cards and printed figures, that is carried on at Venice," was
on the decline, "owing to the great increase of playing-cards with
coloured figures stamped," which were introduced from abroad; and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>that
such importation should be prohibited for the future. Sig. Zanetti, to
whom we are indebted for this information,<a name="fnanchor_87"
id="fnanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> is
of opinion, that they were in use long before 1441; because the art is
seen to have first flourished there, afterwards to have fallen into
disuse, and again revived, owing to the protection afforded it by the
State. These vicissitudes, that suppose the lapse of many years, will
carry us back at least to the commencement of the fifteenth century. To
this period, it appears, we ought <ins title="'to to' in the
original">to</ins> refer those ancient specimens of play-cards, which
were collected for the cabinet of Count Giacomo Durazzo, formerly
imperial ambassador at Venice, and are now to be seen in that of the
Marquis Girolamo, his nephew. They are of larger dimensions than those
now in use, and are of a very strong texture, not unlike that of the
paper made of cotton, found in the ancient manuscripts. The figures are
exhibited on a gold ground in the manner before described;<a
name="fnanchor_88" id="fnanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88"
class="fnanchor">[88]</a> there are three kings, two queens, and two
knaves, one on horseback; and each has a club, or sword, or money. I
could perceive no trace of suits, either because they had not then come
into use, or more probably because so limited a number of cards can
convey no complete idea of the whole game. The design approaches very
nearly to that of Jacobello del Fiore; to the best judges the
workmanship appears the effect of printing, the colours being given by
perforations <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg
109]</a></span>in the die. I know of no other more ancient specimen of
its kind.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile printing of books being introduced into Italy, it
was quickly followed by the practice of ornamenting them with figures in
wood. The Germans had afforded examples of cutting sacred images in this
material,<a name="fnanchor_89" id="fnanchor_89"></a><a
href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and the same was done in
regard to some of the initial letters during the early progress of
typography, a discovery which was extended at Rome, in a book published
in 1467, and at Verona in another, with the date of 1472. The former
contains the Meditations of Card. Turrecremata, with figures also cut in
wood, and afterwards coloured: the latter bears the title of <i>Roberti
Valturii opus de re militari</i>, and it is adorned with a number of
figures, or drawings of machines, fortifications, and assaults; a very
rare work, in the possession of Count Giuseppe Remondini, along with
many other specimens of the earliest period, collected for his private
library, where I saw it. It is worth remarking, that the book of
Turrecremata was printed by Ulderico Han, that of Valturio by Gio. da
Verona, and that in this last the wood-cuts are ascribed to Matteo
Pasti, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg
110]</a></span>the friend of Valturio, and a good painter for those
times.<a name="fnanchor_90" id="fnanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90"
class="fnanchor">[90]</a> After this first progress the art of wood
engraving continued gradually to advance, and was cultivated by many
distinguished men, such as Albert Durer in Germany; in Italy by
Mecherino di Siena, by Domenico delle Greche, by Domenico Campagnola,
and by others down to Ugo da Carpi, who marks a new epoch in this art,
by an invention, of which we shall speak in the school of Modena.</p>

<p>If it be the progress of the human mind to advance from the more easy
to more difficult discoveries, we may venture to suppose that the art of
engraving on wood led to that of engraving on copper; and so, to a
certain extent, it probably did. Vasari, however, who wrote the history
of Tuscan professors, rather than of painting itself, refers its origin
to works in <i>niello</i>, or inlaid modelling work, a very ancient art,
much in use, more especially at Florence, during the fifteenth century;
though it was quite neglected in the following, in spite of the efforts
of Cellini to support it. It was applied to household furniture, silver
ornaments, and sacred vessels, such as holy cups and vases, to missals
and other devotional books, and to reliquaries; as well as to profane
purposes, as adorning the hilts of swords, table utensils, and many
kinds of female ornaments. In some kinds of ebony desks and escrutoires
it was held <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg
111]</a></span>in great request, for its little silver statues, and
modelled plates, representing figures, histories, and flowers. In the
cathedral of Pistoia there still remains a large silver palliotto,
adorned in places with plates, on which are figured images in niello,
and little scripture histories. The method was to cut with the chisel
upon the silver whatever history, portrait, or flowers, was required,<a
name="fnanchor_91" id="fnanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91"
class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and afterwards to fill up the hollow part of
the engraving with a mixture of silver and lead, which, from its dark
colour, was called, by the ancients, <i>nigellum</i>, which our
countrymen curtailed into niello; a substance which, being incorporated
with the silver, produced the effect of shadow, contrasted with its
clearness, and gave to the entire <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>work the appearance of
a chiaroscuro in silver. There were many excellent <i>niellatori</i>, or
inlayers, who cast models with this substance, such as Forzore, brother
to Parri Spinelli of Arezzo, Caradosso and Arcioni of Milan;<a
name="fnanchor_92" id="fnanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92"
class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and three Florentines, who rivalled each other
at S. Giovanni, Matteo Dei, Antonio del Pollaiuolo, and Maso Finiguerra;
specimens of whose <i>paci</i>, cut with wonderful accuracy, acquired
for them the highest reputation.</p>

<p>We are to attribute to Maso, says Vasari, "the beginning of engraving
upon copper," an art, which for the sake of greater perspicuity, I shall
distinguish into three different states; the first of which will be
found as follows. Finiguerra was in the habit of never filling the
little hollows or cuts prepared in the silver plate until he had first
made proof of his work. "For this purpose, as in taking a cast, he
impressed them with earth, upon the top of which having thrown a
quantity of liquid sulphur, they became imprinted, and filled with
smoke; which, with the aid of oil, gave him the effect of the work in
silver. He also produced the same with moistened paper, and with the
same tint or ink, pressing it sufficiently hard with a round roller,
with a smooth surface throughout. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>This gave them not only
the effect of being printed, but that of having been designed with
ink."<a name="fnanchor_93" id="fnanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93"
class="fnanchor">[93]</a> So far we quote Vasari in the preface to his
Life of Marc Antonio. He adds, that in this plan Finiguerra was followed
by Baldini, a Florentine goldsmith; next to whom he mentions Botticelli;
and he might have added the name of Pollaiuolo. Finally, he concludes
that the invention was communicated from Florence to Mantegna at Rome,
and to Martino, called De Clef, in Flanders.</p>

<p>These proofs, the first of their kind, made by Finiguerra, have, for
the most part, perished. Some, which are attributed to him, in
possession of the fathers of Camaldoli, are not ascertained to be his.<a
name="fnanchor_94" id="fnanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114"
id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>We are assured, however, that the
sulphur of the pace<a name="fnanchor_95" id="fnanchor_95"></a><a
href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> cut for S. Giovanni in
1452, upon which he represented the Assumption of our Lady, in a variety
of minute figures, is from his hand. It was formerly in the museum of
the Proposto Gori, who gave a description of it in his Dittici (a
treatise upon a peculiar kind of altar-pieces, tom. iii. p. 315), and it
is now in the Durazzo cabinet, with a memorandum in Gori's own hand, in
which he declares that he had compared it with the original.<a
name="fnanchor_96" id="fnanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96"
class="fnanchor">[96]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115"
id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>Of the proofs made on paper none are
ascertained to exist, with the exception of that of the Assumption
recognized by the Ab. Zani, in the national collection at Paris. It was
made known by him in the year 1803; and to this I may add the Epiphany,
in an inferior style, but more exactly finished, which I found in the
possession of the Senator Martelli, besides a duplicate belonging to S.
E. Seratti. It appears from its style, the work of Finiguerra, and to
have been executed before the Assumption. It is doubtful whether
specimens exist in the ducal gallery, a question which I leave to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg
116]</a></span>solution of abler pens than mine. We have in the Durazzo
collection, the proofs or models of many silversmiths, whose names are
unknown; and for many more we are indebted to Sig. Antonio Armanno, an
excellent connoisseur in prints, to whom I shall have occasion to recur
more than once. Following the ideas thrown out by Vasari in the passage
cited, he concluded that these impressions might happen to have been
confounded <i>with pen designs</i>, owing to the resemblance between
them; he therefore sought for them in collections of designs, and,
having recognized them, purchased them for Count Giacomo, his
patron.</p>

<p>Many of these were met with in the ancient Gadi gallery at Florence;
the work of artificers much inferior to Finiguerra, at least if we
except two specimens not unworthy even of his hand. To these a number of
others were afterwards added from different schools of Italy. Sometimes
we may gather their origin from the design; sometimes with more
certainty from inscriptions, and other unequivocal signs of the period.
For instance, we read the following words in a Presepio,<a
name="fnanchor_97" id="fnanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97"
class="fnanchor">[97]</a> engraved in reversed characters: "Dominus
Philippus Stancharius fieri fecit;" where the family which is named,
along with other circumstances, shew it <ins title="'to to' in the
original.">to</ins> have been executed at Bologna. One small print
represents a woman turning towards a cat; and on it is written, also in
reverse, "<i>Va in la Caneva</i>;" <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>in another we read
<i>Mantengave Dio</i>; both which are either Lombard or Venetian, if we
may judge from the dialect. From all this we have a right to conclude
that Vasari's words, which ascribe to Finiguerra the practice of proving
his works before he inserted the niello, are not to be limited to him
only, or to his school. On the contrary, it appears that Caradosso, as
well as all the best Italian artificers, considered it as no small
portion of their art, and that they only attained correctness in the
process of inlaying and modelling by dint of such proofs, and not by
mere chance. Nor does Vasari's silence militate against this. He
repeatedly complains, in different parts of his work, that he could not
obtain sufficiently full and satisfactory information regarding the
Venetian and Lombard schools; and if he confesses his ignorance of so
many things pertaining to their schools of painting, it is not
surprising that he should know less of their engraving.</p>

<p>The proofs, therefore, of the <i>niellatori</i> on paper are to be
found in all parts of Italy, and they may be particularly known from the
position of the letters, which being written on the original models in
the ordinary way, appear in the impression like the eastern characters,
from right to left; and in like manner the other part of the impression
is seen in reverse; as for instance, a saint is seen standing on the
left hand, who, from his dignity, ought to have occupied the right, and
the actors all write, play music, and do every thing with the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>left
hand. There are other signs which serve to distinguish them; because,
having been pressed by hand, or with a roller, they leave no mark or
furrows in the outlines; nor are we to look for that delicacy and
precision in the lines that appear in impressions from under the press.
They are moreover characterized by their colour, which merely consisted
of lamp black and of oil, or of some other very slight tint; though both
this and the preceding are dubious signs, as we shall shew. It is
conjectured that proofs of a similar<a name="fnanchor_98"
id="fnanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
nature were made by silver carvers, in regard to their graphic labours,
and to others in which the <i>niello</i> was not employed. At all events
they preserved them in their studies, and in those of their pupils, to
whom they afforded a model; and in this way several have been handed
down to our own times.</p>

<p>From these early efforts, the art gradually advanced, as it appears
to me, until it attained what I call the second state of the impression.
When the pleasing effect of these proofs was seen, the idea was struck
out, of forming works in the same delicate and finished taste, and for
this purpose to make use of the same means as had been until then
adopted for impressions in wood. We might thus observe, that in the
workshop of the goldsmith was prepared the art of chalcography, and the
first labours were executed upon silver, upon tin, or, as<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Heineken observes, upon some composition less hard than copper. We may
remark, that such was the practice of the Italians, before they cut
their subjects in copper; but whatever material the first goldsmiths
might adopt, it was not difficult for them to substitute for the shadow
they produced by the <i>niello</i>, the shadow of the cut itself, and to
execute the subject on the reverse, in order to receive the impression
right. From that time, they proceeded gradually to refine the art. Both
the roller and the press which they had then in use were very imperfect,
and, to improve the impression, they first enclosed the plate in a frame
of wood, with four small nails to prevent its slipping; upon this they
placed the paper, and over it a small moist linen cloth, which was then
pressed down with force. Hence, in the first old impressions, we may
plainly trace on the reverse the marks of the linen, for which felt was
next substituted, which leaves no trace behind it.<a name="fnanchor_99"
id="fnanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
They next made trial of various tints; and gave the preference to a
light azure or blue, with which the chief part of the old prints are
coloured.<a name="fnanchor_100" id="fnanchor_100"></a><a
href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The same method <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>was
adopted in forming the fifty cards, which are commonly called the game
of Mantegna. I saw them, for the first time, in possession of his
excellency the Marchese Manfredini, major-domo to the Duke of Tuscany,
whose cabinet is filled with many of the choicest prints. Another copy I
found in possession of the Ab. Boni, and a third formerly belonging to
the Duke of Cassano, was afterwards transferred to the very valuable
collection made by the Senator Prior Seratti. There is also a copy of
this game on a large scale, with some alterations (as, for instance, La
Fede bears a large instead of a small cross, as in the original), and is
of a much later date. A second copy, not so very rare, with a number of
variations, is in existence; and in this the first card bears the
Venetian lion as ensign, with the two letters C. and E. united. The card
of the Doge is inscribed the <i>Doxe</i>; and elsewhere we read in the
same way, <i>Artixan</i>, <i>Famejo</i>, and other words in the Venetian
idiom, which proves that the author of so large and fine a work must
have belonged to the city of Venice or to the state. The design displays
much of Mantegna, and of the Paduan school; though the cut is not
ascertained to be that of Andrea, or of any other known master of that
age. A careful but timid hand is discernible, betraying traces of a
copyist of another's designs, rather than of an original invention. Time
only may possibly clear up this doubt.</p>

<p>Proceeding from cards to books, we are made <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>acquainted with the
first attempts at ornamenting them with cuts in metal. The most
celebrated of these consist of the <i>Monte Santo di Dio</i>, and the
<i>Commedia of Dante</i>, both printed at Florence, and the two editions
of Ptolemy's Geography, at Rome and Bologna; to which we may add the
Geography of Berlinghieri, printed at Florence; all the three
accompanied with tables. The authors of these engravings are not well
known; except so far as we learn from Vasari, that Botticelli was one
who acquired the most reputation. He represented the <i>Inferno, and
took the impression</i>; and the two histories, executed by Gio. de
Lamagna in his Dante, display all the design and composition of Sandro,
so as to leave no doubt of their being his.<a name="fnanchor_101"
id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
Other prints are likewise found pasted in a few of the copies of the
same edition, amounting, more or less, to the number of nineteen; and
their manner is more coarse and mean,<a name="fnanchor_102"
id="fnanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
as we are informed by the Cav. Gaburri, who collected them for his
cabinet. They must have been executed by some inferior hand, and with
the knowledge of the printer, who had left blank spaces in parts of the
work intended to receive the engravings, not yet completed on the
publication of the work. Of a similar cast were other anonymous
engravers of that period, nor is there any name, except those of Sandro
and of Pollaiuolo, truly distinguished in the art among the Florentines.
In Upper Italy, besides <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122"
id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>Mantegna, Bartolommeo Montagna, his
pupil, from Vicenza, (to whom some add Montagna his brother,) and
Marcello Figolino, their fellow citizen, were both well known. Figolino
is asserted to have been the same artist as one <i>Robetta</i>, or
rather one who subscribes himself so, or R. B. T. A.; yet he ought not
to be separated from the Florentine school, to which Vasari refers him,
which the character of his design confirms. The names of Nicoletto da
Modena, F. Gio. Maria da Brescia, a Carmelite monk, and of his brother
Gio. Antonio, have also survived; as well as Giulio and Domenico
Campagnola of Padua. There are not a few anonymous productions which
only announce that they were executed in the Venetian or Lombard manner.
For such artificers as were in the habit of taking impressions from the
roller, either wholly omitted names, or only affixed that of the
designer, or merely gave their own initials, which are now either
doubtful, or no longer understood. For instance, they would write M. F.,
which Vasari interprets into <i>Marc-antonio Francia</i>, while others
read <i>Marcello Figolino</i>, and a third party, <i>Maso
Finiguerra</i>; this last quite erroneously, as, after the most minute
researches, made by the very able Cavaliere Gaburri, throughout
Florence, there is no engraving of that artist to be found.<a
name="fnanchor_103" id="fnanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103"
class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In the Durazzo collection, after twelve
plates, which are supposed to be <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>proofs of the silver
engravers, printed in reverse, we find several others of the first
impressions taken with the roller, and appearing to the right; but not
unlike the proofs in the mechanical part of the impression, and in
regard to the uncertainty of their artists. For this, and other
information on the subject, I am indebted to the kindness of the Ab.
Boni, who having enjoyed the familiar acquaintance of Count Giacomo, is
now engaged in preparing a full account of his fine collection.</p>

<p>The last state of engraving on copper I consider to be that in which
the press and the printing ink being now discovered, the art began to
approach nearer perfection; and it was then it became first separated
from the goldsmith's art, like the full grown offspring, received
pupils, and opened its studio apart. It is difficult to fix the precise
epoch when it attained this degree of perfection in Italy. The same
artificers who had employed the roller, were some of them living, to
avail themselves of the press, such as Nicoletto da Modena, Gio. Antonio
da Brescia, and Mantegna himself, of whose prints there exist, as it
were, two editions; the one with the roller, exhibiting faint tints, the
other in good ink, and from the press. Then the engravers first becoming
jealous lest others should appropriate their reputation, affixed their
own names more frequently to their works; beginning with their initials,
and finally attaching the full name. The Germans held out the earliest
examples, which our countrymen imitated; with one<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> who
surpassed all his predecessors, the celebrated Marc Antonio Raimondi, or
del Francia. He was a native of Bologna, and was instructed in the art
of working in niello by Francesco Francia, in which he acquired singular
skill. Proceeding next to engravings upon metal, he began with engraving
some of the productions of his master. At first he imitated Mantegna,
then Albert Durer, and subsequently perfected himself in design under
Raffaello d'Urbino. This last afforded him further assistance; he even
permitted his own grinder of colours, Baviera, to manage the press, in
order that Marc Antonio might devote himself wholly to engraving
Raffaello's designs, to which we owe the number we meet with in
different collections. He pursued the same plan with the works of
antiquity, as well as those of a few moderns, of Bonarruoti, of Giulio
Romano, and of Bandinelli, besides several others, of which he was both
the designer and engraver. Sometimes he omitted every kind of mark, and
every letter; sometimes he adopted the little tablet of Mantegna, either
with letters or without. In some engravings of the Passion he
counterfeited both the hand and the mark of Albert Durer: and not
unfrequently he gave the initial letters of his own and of Raffaello's
name, and that of Michel Angiolo Fiorentino upon those he engraved after
Bonarruoti. He was assisted by his two pupils, Agostin Veneziano and
Marco Ravignano, who succeeded him in the series of engravings from
Raffaello; which led Vasari to observe, in his Life of Marc<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Antonio, that, "between Agostino and Marco nearly all Raffaello's
designs and paintings had been engraved." These two executed works
conjointly; till at length they parted, and each affixed to his
productions the two initial letters of his name and country.</p>

<p>It was thus the art of engraving in the studio of Raffaello, and by
means of Marc Antonio, and of his school, rose to a high degree of
perfection, not many years after its first commencement. Since that
period no artist has appeared capable of treating it with more knowledge
of design, and with more precision of lines and contour; though in other
points it has acquired much from the hand of Parmigianino, who engraved
in aqua-fortis,<a name="fnanchor_104" id="fnanchor_104"></a><a
href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> from Agostino Caracci,
and from different foreigners of the last century, among whom we may
notice Edelink, Masson, Audran, Drevet, and, in the present age,
several, both Italians and strangers, of whom, in this place, we must
refrain from speaking.</p>

<p>I may be permitted, in this place, to enter into a brief
investigation of the long contested question of engraving upon copper,
whether its discovery is to be attributed to Germany or to Italy; and if
to Italy, whether to Florence or to some other place. Much has been
written upon the subject, both by natives and foreigners, but, if I
mistake <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg
126]</a></span>not, it has scarcely been treated with that accuracy
which is necessary for the attainment of truth. That it is quite
requisite to divide this branch of art into three several states or
stages, I trust I have already sufficiently shewn. In following up this
division we shall have a better chance of ascertaining what portion of
merit ought to be awarded to each country. Vasari, together with
Cellini, in his "Treatise upon the Goldsmith's art," as well as most
other writers, are inclined to refer its commencement to Florence, and
to the artist Finiguerra. Doubts have since arisen; while so recent an
author as Bottari, himself a Florentine, mentions it as a circumstance
not yet ascertained. The epoch of Maso was altered through mistake, by
Manni, who speaks of his decease as happening previous to 1424.<a
name="fnanchor_105" id="fnanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105"
class="fnanchor">[105]</a> This has been corrected by reference to the
authentic books of the <i>Arte de' Mercanti</i>, in which the
<i>pace</i> already cited is mentioned as being paid for in the year
1452. About the same time, Antonio Pollaiuolo, still a youth, as we
learn from Vasari, in his life, was the rival of Finiguerra in the
church of S. Giovanni; and as Maso had at that period already acquired
great celebrity, we may conclude that he was of a mature age, and
experienced in the art. We have further a right to suppose, with Gaburri
and Tiraboschi, that having then taken proofs "of all the subjects which
he had engraved on silver," he had observed this custom from the year
1440, and perhaps earlier; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127"
id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>and we thus discover the elements of
chalcography in Florence, satisfactorily deduced from history.<a
name="fnanchor_106" id="fnanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106"
class="fnanchor">[106]</a> For neither with the aid of history,
monuments, nor reasoning, am I enabled to discover an epoch equally
remote belonging to any other country; as we shall shew, in the first
place, in regard to Germany. It possesses no annals so far back as that
period. The credulity of Sandrart<a name="fnanchor_107"
id="fnanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
led him to question the truth of this, by referring to a small print of
uncertain origin, on which he believed he could read the date 1411, and
upon another that of 1455. At this period, however, when the authority
of Sandrart is of small account, no less from his frequent
contradictions than his partiality, which has rendered him suspected
even by his own countrymen, we may receive his two engravings as false
coin, not valuable enough to purchase the credit of the discovery from
us. Those two distinguished writers, Meerman,<a name="fnanchor_108"
id="fnanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
and the Baron Heineken,<a name="fnanchor_109" id="fnanchor_109"></a><a
href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> were equally bent upon
refuting <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg
128]</a></span>him. They do not pretend to trace any earlier engraver in
Germany than Martin Schön, called by others Bonmartino, and by Vasari,
Martino di Anversa,<a name="fnanchor_110" id="fnanchor_110"></a><a
href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> who died in 1486. Some
are of opinion that he had two brothers, who assisted him, but who are
unknown; and not long after appear the names of Israel Meckeln,<a
name="fnanchor_111" id="fnanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111"
class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Van Bockold, Michael Wolgemuth, master to
Albert Durer, with many others who approached the sixteenth century. It
is contended, however, that engraving on copper was known in Germany
anterior to these; as there exist specimens by doubtful hands, which
<i>have the appearance</i> of being much earlier. Meerman, on the
authority of Christ,<a name="fnanchor_112" id="fnanchor_112"></a><a
href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> adduces one with the
initials C. E. and the date 1465, besides two described by Bar.
Heineken, dated 1466, the first of which is signed <i>f</i>. <img
src="images/image2.jpg" width="12" height="14" alt="Illustration:
Upsidedown 4" title="Upsidedown 4" /> <i>s</i>, the second <i>b x s</i>,
and both the artists unknown. He declares that he had never seen older
engravings that bore a name, (p. 231,) and observes that their manner
resembles <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg
129]</a></span>that of Schön, only coarser, which leads him to suspect
that the authors must have been his masters, (p. 220). But whoever was
Schön's master, Heineken concludes he must have flourished more than ten
years earlier than his time, so as to bring it back to 1450, when the
art of engraving by the burin was undoubtedly practised in Germany, (p.
220). And as if this appeared too little to be granted, he adds, about
four pages further on, "that he was <i>tempted</i> to place the epoch of
its discovery at least towards the year 1440."</p>

<p>The cause is well pleaded, but it is not carried. Let us try to
confront reasons with reasons. The Italians have the testimony of
history in their favour; the Germans have it against them. The former,
without any attempt at exaggeration, proceed as far back as 1440, and
even farther;<a name="fnanchor_113" id="fnanchor_113"></a><a
href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> the latter, by dint of
conjecture, reach as far as 1450, and are only <i>tempted</i> to
anticipate it by ten years date. The Italians commence the art with
Maso, not from his master; the Germans are not content to date from
Schön, but from his master, an advantage they either deny to Italy, and
thus fail to draw an equal comparison; or if they concede the master, we
still anticipate by ten years their origin of chalcography. The
Italians, again, confirm the truth of their history by a number of
authentic documents, proofs in niello, first impressions, and the
progress of the art from its earliest stages to maturity. The Germans
supply their historic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130"
id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>deficiency by monuments, in part proved
to be false, in part doubtful, and which are easily convicted of
insufficiency for the proposed object. Because who can assure us that
the prints of 1465 or 66, are not the production of the brothers or the
disciples of Schön, since Heineken himself confesses that they were
possibly the work of some contemporary artists, his inferiors? Do we not
find in Italy that the followers of Botticelli are inferior to him, and
appear to be of earlier date? Moreover, who can assure us that Schön was
instructed by a master of his own nation; when all his engravings that
have been hitherto produced, appear already perfect in their kind;<a
name="fnanchor_114" id="fnanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114"
class="fnanchor">[114]</a> nor do we find mentioned in Germany either
proofs in niello, or first essays in metals of a softer temper? The fact
therefore, most probably is, what has invariably obtained
credit,&mdash;that the invention was communicated from Italy to Germany,
and as a matter not at all difficult to the goldsmiths, was speedily
practised there with success; I might even add, was greatly improved.
For both the press and printer's ink being well known there, artists
were enabled to add to the mechanic part of the art, improvements with
which Italy was unacquainted; I will produce an example of what I mean,
that cannot fail to convince. Printing of books was discovered in
Germany: history and monuments alike confirm <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>it, which are to be
traced gradually from tabular prints to moveable types, still of wood,
and from these to characters of metal. In such state was the invention
brought to Italy, where, without passing through these intermediate
degrees, books were printed not only in moveable characters of metal,
but with tables cut in copper, thus adding to the art a degree of
perfection which it wanted. Heineken objects that the Germans at that
period had very little correspondence with the cities of Italy, with the
exception of Venice, (p. 139). To this I answer that our universities of
Pisa and Bologna, besides several others, were much frequented by young
men from Germany, at that period; and that for the convenience both of
strangers and of natives, a Dictionary of the German language was
printed at Venice, in 1475, and in 1479, at Bologna; a circumstance
sufficient of itself to prove that there was no little communication
between the two nations. There are, besides, so many other reasons to
believe that a great degree of intercourse subsisted, more particularly
between Germany and Florence,<a name="fnanchor_115"
id="fnanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
during the period <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132"
id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>we treat of; that we ought not to be at
all surprised at the arts belonging to the one being communicated to the
other. Hitherto I have pleaded, as far as lay in my power, the cause of
my country; though without having been able, I fear, to bring the
question to a close. Some time, it is possible, that those earliest
essays and proofs of the art, which have hitherto eluded research, may
be discovered: it is possible that some one of their writers, who are at
once so truly learned and so numerous, may improve upon the hint thrown
out by Heineken (p. 139), that the Germans and the Italians, without any
kind of corresponding knowledge on the subject, struck out simultaneous
discoveries of the modern art. However this may chance to be, it is my
part to write from the information and authorities which I have before
me.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether, on the exclusion of Germany, there is
any other part of Italy that may have anticipated the discovery of
Finiguerra at Florence. Some of his opponents have ventured to question
his title on the strength of metallic impressions of seals, which are
met with on Italian parchments from the earliest periods. This shews
only that the art advanced during several ages on the verge of this
invention; but it does not prove that the very origin of the discovery
is to be sought for in seals; otherwise we should be bound to commence
the history of modern typography from the seals of earthen-ware, with
which our museums abound. No one will contend <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>that certain immemorial
and undigested elements that lay for many ages neglected and unformed,
ought to have a place in the history of art; and this we are now
treating on, ought not to date its commencement beyond the period when
silversmiths' shops had been established, where, in fact, it took its
origin and grew to maturity. We must then compare the proofs remaining
to us of their labours, and see whether such proofs were in use at any
other place, before the time of Finiguerra. I might observe that there
are two threads, as it were, which may serve as a clue to this
labyrinth, until we may somewhere or by some means ascertain the actual
date; and these two are the character and the design. The character in
all the proofs I have examined, is not at all (as we commonly call it)
of a gothic description; it is round and roman, according to the
observation before made (at p. 49), and does not lead us farther back
than the year 1440. The design is more suspicious: in the Durazzo
collection I have seen proofs of nielli with more coarse designs than
are displayed in the works of Maso, but they are perhaps not the
offspring of the Florentine school. I shall not here attempt to
anticipate the judgment of those who may engage to illustrate these
ancient remains; nor that of the public, in regard to the engravings
correctly taken from them, which must pronounce their definitive
sentence. If I mistake not, however, true connoisseurs will be cautious
how they pass a final opinion. It will not be difficult for them to
discern a Bolognese from a Florentine <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>artist, in modern
painting, after it is seen that each school formed its own peculiar
character both in colouring and in design; but in regard to proofs of
nielli,<a name="fnanchor_116" id="fnanchor_116"></a><a
href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> to distinguish school
from school, will not be so easy a task. For though it may be
ascertained, for instance, that such a proof came from Bologna; can we
pronounce from the fact of its being coarser and rawer than the designs
of Finiguerra, that it is so far more ancient? Maso and the Florentines,
after the time of Masaccio, had already softened their style towards the
year 1440; but can we assert the same of the other schools of Italy?
Besides, is it certain that the silversmiths, from whose hands proceeded
the proofs, sought out the best designers;<a name="fnanchor_117"
id="fnanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
and did not copy, for instance, the Bolognese, the design of a Pietà by
Jacopo Avanzi, or the Venetians, a Madonna by Jacobello del Fiore? The
more dry, coarse, and clumsy specimens therefore, cannot easily be
adduced against Finiguerra as a proof of greater antiquity; otherwise we
should run into the whimsical sophistry of Scalza, who affirmed that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg
135]</a></span>Baronci were the most ancient men in Florence, and in the
whole world, because they were the ugliest.<a name="fnanchor_118"
id="fnanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
We must therefore permit Maso to rest quietly in possession of the
discovery, until further and more ancient proofs are adduced, than are
to be found in his cards and his zolfi.</p>

<p>In my account of the second state of engraving, I shall not make
mention of the German masters, in regard to whom I have not dates that
may be thought sufficient; I shall confine my attention to those of
Italy. I shall compare the testimony of Vasari and Lomazzo; one of whom
supposes the art to have originated in Upper, the other in Lower Italy.
In his Life of Marc Antonio, Vasari observes, that Finiguerra "was
followed by Baccio Baldini, a Florentine goldsmith, who being little
skilled in design, every thing he executed was after designs and
inventions of Sandro Botticello. As soon as Andrea Mantegna learned this
circumstance at Rome, he first began to turn his attention to the
engraving of his own works." Now in the life of Sandro he makes
particular mention of the time when he applied himself to the art, which
was at the period he had completed his labours in the Sistine chapel.
Returning directly after to Florence, "he began to comment upon Dante,
he drew the Inferno, and engraved it, which occupying a large portion of
his time, was the occasion of much trouble and inconvenience in his
future life." Botticelli is here considered an engraver from about<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
1474, at the age of thirty-seven years; and Baldini, who executed every
thing from the designs of Sandro, also practised the art. At the same
period flourished Antonio Pollaiuolo, who acquired a higher reputation
than either of the last. Few of his impressions remain, but among these
is the celebrated battle of the naked soldiers, approaching nearest in
point of power to the bold style of Michelangiolo. The epoch of these
productions is to be placed about 1480, because having acquired great
celebrity by them, he was invited to Rome towards the close of 1483, to
raise the monument of Sixtus IV., who died in that year.</p>

<p>According to Vasari, Mantegna having decorated the chapel of Innocent
VIII. at Rome, about 1490,<a name="fnanchor_119"
id="fnanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
from that or the preceding year is intitled to the name of engraver,
computing it from about his sixtieth year. He flourished more than
sixteen years after this period; during which is it to be believed that
he produced that amazing number of engravings,<a name="fnanchor_120"
id="fnanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
amounting to more than fifty, of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>which about thirty
appear to be genuine specimens, on so grand a scale, so rich in figures,
so finely studied and Mantegnesque in every part; that he executed these
when he was already old, new to the art, an art fatiguing to the eye and
the chest even of young artists; that he pursued it amidst his latest
occupations in Mantua, which we shall, in their place, describe, and
that he produced such grand results within sixteen or seventeen years.
Either Vasari must have mistaken the dates, or wished to impose upon our
credulity by his authority. Lomazzo leads us to draw a very different
conclusion, when in his Treatise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138"
id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> (p. 682) he adds this short eulogy to
the name and merits of Mantegna, "a skilful painter, and the first
engraver of prints in Italy;" but wherein he does not mention him as an
inventor, meaning only to ascribe to him the merit of introducing the
second state of the art at least in Italy; because he believed that it
had already arisen in Germany. Such authority as this is worth our
attention. I shall have occasion in the course of my narrative to combat
some of Lomazzo's assertions; but I shall also feel bound to concur with
him frequently in the epochs illustrated by him. He was born about
twenty-five years subsequent to Vasari; he had more erudition, was a
better critic, and on the affairs of Lombardy in particular, was enabled
to correct him, and to supply his deficiencies. I am not surprised,
then, that Meerman (p. 259) should suppose Andrea to have been already
an engraver before the time of Baldini and Botticelli; I could have
wished only that he had better observed the order of the epochs, and not
postponed the praise due to him until the pontificate of Innocent VIII.
In fact, it is not easy to ascertain the exact time when Mantegna first
directed his attention to the art of engraving. It decidedly appears
that he commenced at Padua; for the very confidence he displays in every
plate, shews that he could be no novice; nor is it credible that his
noviciate began only in old age. I suspect he received the rudiments of
the art from Niccolo, a distinguished goldsmith, as he gave his<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
portrait, together with that of Squarcione, in a history piece of S.
Cristoforo, at the Eremitani in Padua; each most probably being a
tribute of respect to his former master. It is true that we meet with no
specimens of his hand at that, or even a later period of his early life;
though we ought to recollect that he never affixed any dates to his
works. So that it is impossible to say that none of them were the
production of his earlier years, however equal and beautiful they appear
in regard to their style; inasmuch as in his paintings we are enabled to
detect little difference between his history of S. Cristoforo, painted
in the flower of youth, and his altar-piece at S. Andrea of Mantua,
which is considered one of his last labours. A specimen of his engraving
with a date, is believed, however, by some, to be contained in a book of
Pietro d'Abano; intitled "Tractatus de Venenis," published in Mantua,
1472, "in cujus paginâ prima littera initialis aeri incisa exhibetur,
quæ integram columnæ latitudinem occupat. Patet hinc artem
chalcographicam jam anno 1472 extitisse." Thus far writes the learned
Panzer,<a name="fnanchor_121" id="fnanchor_121"></a><a
href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> but whether he ever saw
the work that exists in folio, and of seven pages, I am not certain.<a
name="fnanchor_122" id="fnanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122"
class="fnanchor">[122]</a> A quarto edition <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>was likewise edited in
Mantua, 1473, and a copy is there preserved in the public library, but
without any plates.</p>

<p>It is certain, however, that about this period copper engraving was
practised, not only in Mantua, where Mantegna resided, but also in
Bologna. The geography of Ptolemy, printed in Bologna by Domenico de
Lapis, with the apparently incorrect date of 1462, is in the possession
of the Corsini at Rome, and of the Foscarini at Venice.<a
name="fnanchor_123" id="fnanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123"
class="fnanchor">[123]</a> It contains twenty-six geographical tables,
engraved very coarsely, yet so greatly admired by the printer, that he
applauds this new discovery, and compares it to the invention of
printing, which not long before had appeared in Germany. We give his
words as they are quoted from the Latin without being refuted, by
Meerman, at p. 251: "Accedit mirifica imprimendi tales tabulas ratio,
cujus inventoris laus nihil illorum laude inferior, qui primi litterarum
imprimendarum artem pepererunt, in admirationem sui studiosissimum
quemque facillime convertere potest." The same writer, however, along
with other learned men, contends that the date ought to be corrected,
chiefly on the authority of the catalogue of the correctors of the work,
among whom we find Filippo Beroaldo, who, in 1462, was no more than nine
years of age. Hence Meerman infers, that we ought to read 1482;
Audifredi <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg
141]</a></span>and others, 1491; neither of which opinions I can agree
with. For the work of Ptolemy being published at Rome, accompanied by
twenty-seven elegant charts in 1478, what presumption, or rather folly,
in the publisher of the Bolognese edition, to think of applauding its
beauty, after the appearance of one so incomparably superior! I am
therefore compelled to refer the former to an earlier period than the
last mentioned year. Besides, I ought to inform the reader, that the
engraving of twenty-six geographical plates, full of lines, distances,
and references, must have been a long and difficult task, particularly
during the infancy of the art, sufficient to occupy several years; as we
are certain that three or four were devoted to the same purpose at Rome
by more modern engravers, far more expert. We are therefore bound to
antedate the epoch of the Bolognese engraving several years before the
publication of the book, which belongs perhaps to the year 1472.<a
name="fnanchor_124" id="fnanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124"
class="fnanchor">[124]</a> I shall not, however, set myself up as an
umpire in this dispute; anxiously expecting, as I do, an excellent
treatise from the pen of Sig. Bartolommeo Gamba; which I feel assured
will not fail to gratify the public.<a name="fnanchor_125"
id="fnanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg
142]</a></span>In regard to Bologna, therefore, I shall only seek to
prove that the progress of the goldsmith's art to that of engraving upon
metal, was more rapid than it has been supposed. Heineken himself
observes, in describing the Ptolemy, that it is evident, from the traces
of the zigzag, which the goldsmiths are in the habit of putting on the
silver plates, the work is the production of one belonging to that art.
The earliest works that can be pointed out with certainty at Florence,
are the three elegant engravings of the Monte Santo di Dio, published in
1477; and the two in the two cantos of Dante, 1481; one of which, as if
a third engraving, was repeated in the same book; while all of them seem
to have been drawn from the roller, the art of inserting the plates in
the letter-press being then unknown. We have yet to notice the
thirty-seven geographical charts, in whatever way executed, affixed to
the book of Berlinghieri, which was printed about the same period,
without any date. These also contain several heads with the names
<i>Aquilo</i>, <i>Africus</i>, &amp;c., but they are all of youthful
appearance, and tolerable in point of design; whereas the same heads in
Bologna are of different ages, with long beards and caps, and in a
coarser manner. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143"
id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>The three before<ins title="hyphenated
in the original"> </ins>mentioned works appeared from the press of
Niccolo Tedesco, or Niccolo di Lorenzo de Lamagna, the first who printed
books at Florence with copper plates.</p>

<p>The last and most complete state of engraving upon copper, comes next
under our notice. For this improvement, it appears to me, we are as much
indebted to Germany as for the art of printing books. The press there
first discovered for typography, opened the way for that applied to
copper plates. The mechanical construction to be sure was different, in
the former the impression being drawn from cast letters which rise
outwards; in the latter from plates cut hollow within by the artist's
graver. A kind of ink was at the same time adopted, of a stronger and
less fuliginous colour, than had been used for engravings in wood; but
as it is termed by Meerman (p. 12), "singulare ac tenuius." The same
author fixes the date of this improvement in the art at about 1470; and
most probably he meant to deduce it from the earliest copper engravings
which appeared in Germany. Of this I cannot venture to speak, not having
seen the two specimens cited by Heineken, and the others that bear a
date; nor is it at all connected with our present history of Italian
art, as far as regards engraving. We gather from it, that such
improvement was brought to us from Germany by the same Corrado Sweyneym,
who prepared the beautiful edition of Ptolemy at Rome. We learn from the
anonymous preface prefixed, that Corrado devoted three years<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> to
the task, and left it incomplete; and it was continued by Arnold
Buckinck, and published by him, as I already observed, in 1478. The
tables are engraved with a surprising degree of elegance, and are taken
from the press, as Meerman, adopting the opinion of Raidelio, and of
such bibliographers as have described it, has clearly shewn, (p. 258).
It is conjectured that Corrado commenced his labours about 1472, a fact
ascertained no less from the testimony of Calderino, the corrector of
the work, than from the tables, impressions of which were taken in
1475.<a name="fnanchor_126" id="fnanchor_126"></a><a
href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Some are of opinion that
the engraving was from the hand of Corrado, although the author of the
preface simply observes, "animum ad hanc doctrinam capessendam applicuit
(that is, to geography) subinde matematicis adhibitis viris quemadmodum
tabulis æneis imprimerentur edocuit,<a name="fnanchor_127"
id="fnanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
triennioque in hâc curâ consumpto diem obiit." And it seems very
probable, that as he employed Italians in the correction of the text, he
was also assisted by some one of the same nation in the engravings. It
strikes me, likewise, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145"
id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>that Botticelli was attracted by this
novel art at Rome, since on his return about the year 1474, he began to
engrave copper plates with all the ardour that Vasari has described, and
was in fact the first who represented full figures and histories in the
new art. Perhaps the cause of his impressions being less perfect than
others, arose from his ignorance of the method of printing upon a single
page, both the plates and the characters; as well as from the want of
the press, and that improved plan derived from the office of the German
printers. But from whatever cause, it is certain, that our engravers
long continued to labour under this imperfection in the art, as I have
already recounted. In the time of Marc Antonio, who rose into notice
soon after the year 1500, the art, in its perfect state, had been
introduced into Italy, insomuch that he was enabled to rival Albert
Durer and Luca d'Ollanda, equalling them in the mechanism of the art,
and surpassing them in point of design. It is from this triumvirate of
genius that the more finished age of engraving takes its date; and
nearly at the same period we behold the most improved era in the art of
painting. The completion of the new art soon diffused good models of
design through every school, which led the way to the new epoch.
Following the steps of Durer, the imitators of nature learned to design
more correctly; while they composed, if not with much taste, at least
with great variety and fertility, examples of which appear in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>the
Venetian artists of the time. Others of a more studied character, formed
upon the model of Raffaello and of the best Italian masters, exhibited
by Marc Antonio, applied with more diligence to compose with order, and
to attain elegance of design; as we shall further see in the progress of
this History of Painting, which after such necessary interruption, we
prepare once more to resume.</p>

In the ancient monastery of Certosa, at Buxheim, there remains a figure
of S. Cristoforo in the act of passing the river, with Jesus upon his
shoulders; and there is added that of a hermit lighting the way with a
lantern in his hand. It bears the date 1423. A number of other devout
images are seen in the celebrated library at Wolfenbuttel, and others in
Germany, stamped upon wood in a manner similar to that of playing-cards.

There was collected for the ducal gallery in 1801, a silver <i>pace</i>
that had been made for the company of S. Paolo, and sold upon the
suppression of that pious foundation. It represents the saint's
conversion, with many tolerably executed figures, from an unknown hand,
though less old and valuable than that of Maso. He had ornamented it
with niello; but in order to ascertain the workmanship, it was taken to
pieces some years since, and the plate examined in the state it came
from under the tools of the silversmith. The cuts were found not at all
deep, resembling those of our engravers upon sheets of copper, upon the
model of which the silver plate, being provided with the ink, was put
into the press, and from it were taken as many, perhaps, as twenty fine
proofs. One of these is in the collection of the Senator Bali Martelli;
and upon this a foreign connoisseur wrote that it was the work of Doni,
I know not on what authority, unless, from an error of memory, the name
Doni was inserted instead of Dei.</p>

Vasari, who is difficult to understand, at least by many, on account of
his brevity, touches upon the different processes used by Maso, which
are these: When he had cut the plate, he next proceeded to take a print
of it, before he inlaid it with niello, upon very fine earth; and from
the cut being to the right hand, and hollow, the proof consequently came
out on the left, shewing the little earthen cast in relief. Upon this
last he threw the liquid sulphur, from which he obtained a second proof,
which, of course, appeared to the right, and took from the relief a
hollow form. He then laid the ink (lamp <ins title="'blank' in the
original">black </ins>or printer's ink) upon the sulphur, in such a way
as to fill up the hollows on the more indented cuts, intended to produce
the shadow; and next, by degrees, he scraped away from the ground (of
the sulphur) what was meant to produce the light. And this is also the
plan pursued in engraving on copper. The final work was to polish it
with oil, in order to give the sulphur the bright appearance of
silver.</p>

They are to be seen in a little portable altar; and are most probably
the proofs of some niello worker of the time; who had executed those
histories in silver to ornament some similar little altar, or the place
in which sacred relics were laid. Before introducing the niello, he had
cast proofs of his work in these zolfi (sulphurs), which were
subsequently inlaid with great symmetry and taste in the altar-piece.
They consist of various forms and sizes, and are adapted to the
architecture of the little altar, and to its various parts. Many of them
have now perished, though several are yet in existence, the smallest of
which chiefly represent histories from scripture, and the largest of
them the acts of the Evangelists, to the number of fourteen, and about
one-sixth of a braccio (an arm, two-thirds of a yard) in height.</p>

In this edition I ought to mention another zolfo (a sulphur cast) of the
same pace of S. Giovanni, in possession of his excellency the Senator
Prior Seratti. This, when compared with the model, corresponds line for
line; there is a full display of the very difficult character of Maso's
heads, and what is still more decisive, is, that it is cut, or indented,
an effect that must have been produced according to the manner already
described. The zolfo Durazzo, as appears from the impression, does not
correspond so well; some of the flowers and ornaments of drapery are
wanting; it is not equally finished, and it seems smooth on the surface.
This does not derogate from its genuineness, for as several proofs were
taken of the same <i>pace</i>, which was cut by degrees, if we find less
completeness in the Durazzo proof, it is only an indication of its
having been taken before the rest. And if the impressions of the cuts
are not so plainly traced as in the other, I do not, therefore,
conjecture that they do not exist. The zolfi of the fathers of Camaldoli
already cited, seem as if they were printed, and smooth. A fragment
breaking off, highly polished on the surface, the cuts were then
discovered, even to the minutest lines, as many professors, even the
most experienced in the art of printing, to their surprise, have
witnessed; and they conjectured that the ocular illusion might arise,
1st, from the fineness of cut made with the style, or possibly with the
graver, which was diminished in proportion as it passed from the sheet
to the earthen mould, and from this to the zolfo; 2d, from the density
of the ink, when hardened between the cuts or hollows of the zolfo; 3d,
from a coat of bluish colour laid on the work, of which there remain
traces, and from that which time produces both in paintings and on
cards. I have not a doubt, that, if the experiment were tried on the
Durazzo zolfo, the result would appear exactly the same. The extrinsic
proofs of its origin, also adduced by Gori, together with the aspect of
the monument, which is fresh in my memory, do not authorize me to
suspect the existence of a fraud.</p>

The Florentine merchants, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,
especially such as advanced money upon interest, abounded in Germany;
insomuch that part of a town was called <i>Borgo Fiorentino</i>. This I
learn from Dottore Gennari, a Paduan gentleman, not long since lost to
the republic of letters. The number of German Princes who coined money
in Florence, may be gathered from the work of Orsini, and other writers,
upon our modern coinage.</p>

The direction given by the Ab. Zani for similar specimens is this: "The
engravings of the Venetian school, generally speaking, are of a
delicate, soft, and full design; the figures are large, few, and very
beautiful in the extremities. Those of the Florentines are engraved in a
stronger manner, and are less soft and round; sometimes even harsh; the
figures are small, pretty numerous, with the extremities less highly
finished." Materiali, p. 57.</p>

Forty of these I find cited, and I am informed of some others not yet
edited. The Ab. Zani (p. 142) assures us "that the genuine impressions
which are now acknowledged to be from the hand of Mantegna, do not
amount to twenty; and nearly all of them are executed with few figures."
Such an assertion appears no less singular to me than to others on whose
judgment I could rely, whom I have consulted. How can we admit its
accuracy, when confronted with the account of Mantegna's fellow citizen
and contemporary Scardeone, who collected his works, and who expressly
declares, as cited by the Ab. Zani, "that Mantegna engraved Roman
triumphs, Bacchanalian festivals, and marine deities: also the descent
of Christ from the cross, and the burial," engravings exhibiting a
variety of figures, and in number more than a dozen. After this
enumeration the historian adds, "et alia permulta," and many others. To
confute this excellent testimony, the Ab. Zani refers only to the words
of the same Scardeone, who thus continues: "Those plates are possessed
by few, and held in the highest esteem; nine of them, however, belong to
me, all of them different." This writer therefore, in spite of his
expression "et alia permulta," confesses that he had only nine specimens
from the hand of his fellow citizen. Yes, I reply, he confesses his
scanty portion, but admits the superior number that exists in various
cabinets, and what reason have we for believing the first assertion and
not the second? For my part, I give credit to the historian; and if any
one doubt, from a diversity of style between the plates, that there is
any exaggeration in his statement, I should not hence conclude that they
are from different hands, but executed by the same hand, the works of
the artist's early life being inferior to his last. For what artist ever
devoted himself to a new branch, and did not contrive to cultivate and
improve it? It is sufficient that the taste be not wholly opposite.</p>

That is, in Rome, where he also taught the art of printing books, as we
are informed in the same preface. This last is wholly devoted to Roman
matters, and it would be vain to look in it for the general history of
typography and engraving in Italy. It appears then, that Sweyneym
instructed the artists of Rome in the best manner of printing from
copper plates with the press; though others may have taught the art of
printing them more rudely and in softer metal at Bologna.</p>

<h4 class="p4">FLORENTINE SCHOOL.</h4>

<h4>EPOCH II.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Vinci, Bonarruoti, and other celebrated
artists, form the most flourishing era of this School.</i></div>

<p class="p2">Nations have their virtues and their vices; and it is the
duty of the historian to give them credit for the one, and to confess
the other. Thus it is with the Schools of Painting; no one of which is
so perfect as to leave us nothing more to desire; no one so faulty that
it has not much in it to commend. The Florentine school (I do not speak
of its greatest masters, but of the general practice of the others) had
no great merit in colouring, from which Mengs was induced to denominate
it a melancholy school; nor did it excel in its drapery, from which
arose the saying, that the drapery of figures appeared to be fashioned
with economy in Florence.</p>

<p>It did not shine in power of relief, a study not generally cultivated
till the last century, nor did it exhibit much beauty, because, long
destitute of fine Grecian statues, Florence was late in possessing the
Venus: and only through the attention of the Grand Duke Leopold, has
been enriched by the Apollo, the group of Niobe, and other choice
specimens. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg
148]</a></span>From these circumstances this school aimed only at a
fidelity of representation that resembles the works of those who copied
exactly from nature, and in general made a judicious selection of its
objects. It could not boast of superior grouping in the composition of a
picture, and it was more inclined to erase a superfluous figure, than to
add one unnecessarily to the rest. In grace, in design, and in historic
accuracy, it excels most other schools; chiefly resulting from the great
learning that always adorned this city, and invariably gave a bias to
the erudition of her artists.</p>

<p>Design forms the peculiar excellence of this school, and its
hereditary patrimony, to which the national characteristic of minute
correctness has greatly contributed; and it may justly be observed, that
this people has excelled others no less in the symmetrical delineation
of the figure, than in purity of idiom. It may also boast of having
produced a great many excellent painters in fresco; an art so superior
to that of painting in oil, that Bonarruoti looked on the latter as mere
sport, when compared with the former, as it necessarily requires great
dexterity, and the talent of executing well and with rapidity, very
difficult attainments in any profession. This school had but few
engravers on copper, from which circumstance, though abounding in
historians,<a name="fnanchor_128" id="fnanchor_128"></a><a
href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and rich in paintings,
it has not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg
149]</a></span>a sufficient number of prints to make it known in
proportion to its merit; a defect which the <i>Etruria Pittrice</i> has
in some measure supplied. Finally, the reader may indulge in this very
just reflection, that the Florentine school first taught the method of
proceeding scientifically, and according to general rules. Some other
schools have originated in an attentive consideration of natural
effects; by mechanically imitating, if we may be allowed the expression,
the external appearances of objects. But Vinci and Bonarruoti, the two
great luminaries of this school, like true philosophers pointed out the
immutable objects and established laws of nature, thence deducing rules
which their successors, both at home and abroad, have followed with
great benefit to the art. The former has left a Treatise on Painting,
and the public were induced to look for the publication of the precepts
of the latter, which have however never yet been produced;<a
name="fnanchor_129" id="fnanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129"
class="fnanchor">[129]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150"
id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>and we obtain some idea of his maxims
only from Vasari, and other writers. About this time also flourished Fra
Bartolommeo, Andrea del Sarto, Rosso, the young Ghirlandaio, and other
artists, whom we shall name in the sequel of this grand epoch, which
unfortunately was of short duration. Towards the middle of the sixteenth
century, when Michelangiolo, who survived the other great artists, was
still living, a less auspicious era began; but we must proceed with this
epoch.</p>

<p>Lionardo da Vinci, so called from a castle in lower Valdarno, was the
natural son of one Pietro, notary to the Florentine republic, and was
born in 1452.<a name="fnanchor_130" id="fnanchor_130"></a><a
href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> He was endowed by nature
with a genius uncommonly elevated and penetrating, eager after
discovery, and diligent in the pursuit; not only in what related to the
three arts dependant on design, but in mathematics, in mechanics, in
hydrostatics, in music, in poetry, and also in the accomplishments of
horsemanship, fencing, and dancing. He was so perfect in all these, that
when he performed any one, the beholder was ready to imagine that it
must have been his sole study. To such vigour of intellect he joined an
elegance of features and of manners, that graced <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>the
virtues of his mind. He was affable with strangers, with citizens, with
private individuals, and with princes, among whom he long lived on a
footing of familiarity and friendship. On this account, says Vasari, it
cost him no effort always to behave and to live like a man of high
birth.</p>

<p>Verrocchio taught him painting; and as we have said, while still a
youth, he surpassed his master. He retained traces of his early
education through his whole life. Like Verrocchio, he designed more
readily than he painted; he assiduously cultivated mathematics; in his
design and in his countenances, he prized elegance and vivacity of
expression, more than dignity and fulness of contour; he was very
careful in drawing his horses, and in representing the skirmishes of
soldiers; and was more solicitous to improve the art than to multiply
his pictures. He was an excellent statuary, as is demonstrated by his S.
Tommaso in Orsanmichele at Florence, and by the horse in the church of
S. John and S. Paul at Venice. Vinci not only modelled in a superior
manner the three statues cast in bronze by Rustici, for the church of S.
John at Florence, and the colossal horse at Milan, but assisted by this
art, he gave that perfect relief and roundness, in which painting was
then wanting. He likewise imparted to it symmetry, grace, and spirit;
and these and his other merits gave him the title of the father of
modern painting,<a name="fnanchor_131" id="fnanchor_131"></a><a
href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> though<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
some of his works, as was observed by Mariette, participate, in some
degree, in the meanness of the old school.</p>

<p>He had two styles, the one abounded in shadow, which gives admirable
brilliancy to the contrasting lights; the other was more quiet, and
managed by means of middle tints. In each style, the grace of his
design, the expression of the mental affections, and the delicacy of his
pencil, are unrivalled. Every thing is lively in his paintings, the
foreground, the landscape, the adventitious ornaments of necklaces,
flowers, and architecture; but this gaiety is more apparent in the
heads. In these he purposely repeats the same idea, and gives them a
smile which delights the mind of a spectator. He did not, however,
consider his pictures as complete, but from a singular timidity,<a

class="fnanchor">[132]</a> often left them imperfect, as I shall more
fully state under the Milanese school. There he will appear with the
dignity of a consummate master, and a portion of his fame must at
present suffice for his native school.</p>

<p>The life of Lionardo may be divided into four periods, the first of
which includes the time he remained <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>at Florence, while
still a young man. To this era may be referred, not only the Medusa of
the royal gallery, and the few pieces mentioned by Vasari; but some
others also, less powerful in the shadows, and less diversified in the
folds of the drapery, and which present some heads more delicate than
select, and apparently derived from the school of Verrocchio. Such is
the Magdalen of the Pitti palace at Florence, and that of the
Aldobrandini palace at Rome; some Madonnas and Holy Families which are
in several collections, as in the Giustiniani and Borghese galleries;
and some heads of the Redeemer and of the Baptist, which are to be seen
in various places; although it is often reasonable to suspend our
judgment in regard to the genuineness of such pieces, on account of the
great number of Lionardo's imitators. The child, laid in a bed richly
ornamented, enveloped in its clothes, and adorned with a necklace, which
is in the house of his excellency the Gonfaloniere of Bologna, is of a
different class, and of undoubted originality.</p>

<p>After this first period, Lionardo was brought to Milan by Lodovico
Sforza, "whom he highly gratified by his performance on the lyre; a
curious and new instrument, almost entirely of silver," which Lionardo
carried with him, and had constructed with his own hands. All the
musicians there assembled were vanquished, and the whole city being
struck with admiration of his extemporaneous poetry, and his eloquence,
he was retained by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154"
id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>prince, and remained there till 1499,
engaged in abstruse studies, and in mechanical and hydrostatical labours
for the service of the state. During this time he painted little, except
the celebrated Last Supper; but by superintending an academy of the fine
arts, he left a degree of refinement in Milan, which was so productive
of illustrious pupils, that this period may be reckoned the most
glorious era of his life.</p>

<p>After the misfortunes of Lodovico Sforza, he returned to Florence,
where having remained thirteen years, he went to Rome at the time his
patron Leo X. ascended the papal chair; but his stay there was short.
Some of his best works at Florence may be referred to this period; among
which number we may reckon the celebrated portrait of Mona Lisa, which
was the labour of four years, and yet was left unfinished; the Cartoon
of S. Anna, prepared for a picture in the church of the Servi, which was
never executed in colours; the cartoon of the battle of Niccolo
Piccinino, intended to dispute the palm of excellence with Michelangiolo
in the council chamber at Florence,<a name="fnanchor_133"
id="fnanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
but like the other, never executed by Vinci, after failing in an attempt
to paint it in a new method in oil on the wall. He probably employed
another method in painting <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155"
id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>the Madonna with the child in her arms,
in the monastery of S. Onofrio, of Rome, a picture in the style of
Raffaello, but which is now peeling off the walls in many places. There
are some other fine pieces, which if we may be allowed to hazard a
conjecture, might be with propriety assigned to this period, in which
Lionardo, having attained his highest skill, and unoccupied by other
pursuits, painted in his best manner. Such is the specimen that was
preserved at Mantua, but which was stolen, and concealed during the sack
of the city; after many vicissitudes, however, it was sold for a high
price to the imperial court of Russia. The subject is a Holy Family; in
the back-ground is seen a woman of a very beautiful and majestic
countenance standing in an upright position. It bears the cipher of
Lionardo, consisting of a D interlaced with an L and a V, as it is seen
in the picture of the Signori Sanvitali, at Parma. The Consigliere
Pagave, who left a memorandum of it in his MSS. was the first to observe
and to recognise it, upon its being brought to Milan in 1775, where it
was also kept concealed. The same judicious critic in painting has
conjectured that this production was executed in Rome, for one of the
princesses of Mantua, or rather for the sister-in-law of Leo X.;
inasmuch as it displayed a decided emulation of Raphael's manner, at
that time highly extolled in Rome. Such a conjecture might receive
support from his picture of a Madonna, which ornaments San Onofrio, also
in the Raphael manner; and in order that <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>this picture, and that
of Mantua just mentioned, might not be confounded by posterity with the
works of Raffaello, Lionardo, according to Signor Pagave, took care to
affix the cipher of his name. Indeed, this is not at all improbable:
both writers and painters are impelled by their natural genius to adopt
a peculiar style; and whoever will compare the portraits that remain,
expressive of the elevated, touching, penetrating, and beautiful spirit,
incessantly bent upon acquiring something still more exquisite in art,
which inspired these two prodigies, will find little difficulty in
believing that both produced works, which owing to a similarity of
natural taste, selection and admiration of the same object, might be
mistaken for specimens of the same hand. Of this number is his own
portrait, at an age which corresponds with this period, in the ducal
gallery, a head that surpasses every other in that room for energy of
expression; also another head, which is in a different cabinet, and is
called a portrait of Raffaello; together with the half-length figure of
a young nun so much commended by Bottari, and which he points out as one
of the greatest treasures in the splendid mansion of the Marchese
Niccolini. In the same rank we may include the much admired specimens in
the possession of some of the noble families at Rome; as the picture of
Christ disputing in the Temple, and the supposed portrait of queen
Giovanna, ornamented with fine architecture, in the Doria palace; the
Vanity and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg
157]</a></span>Modesty in the Barberini palace, the tints of which no
pencil has been able to imitate; the Madonna of the Albani Palace, that
appears to be requesting the lily which the infant Jesus holds in his
hand, while he draws back, as if unwilling to part with it; a picture of
exquisite grace, and preferred by Mengs to every other painting
contained in that fine collection. It would, however, be presumptuous to
assign a date to every picture of an artist who became early a
distinguished painter, and who frequently discontinued a work before it
was completed.</p>

<p>When this celebrated artist had attained his sixty-third year, he
appears to have renounced the art for ever. Francis I. who saw his Last
Supper at Milan, about the year 1515, attempted to saw it from the wall,
that it might be transported to France; and not succeeding in his
project, was desirous of possessing the artist, though now an old man.
He invited Vinci to his court, and the artist felt little regret at
leaving Florence, where, since his return, he found in the young
Bonarruoti a rival that had already contended with him, and was even
employed in preference to Vinci both in Florence and in Rome; because
the former gave them works, if we may credit Vasari, while the latter
amused them with words.<a name="fnanchor_134" id="fnanchor_134"></a><a
href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> It is known that they
had a quarrel; and Lionardo consulting his repose,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
which their emulation embittered, passed over into France, where, before
he had employed his pencil, he expired in the arms of Francis I., in the
year 1519.</p>

<p>Though his style is highly worthy of imitation, it was less followed
in Florence than in Milan; nor is this surprising. Vinci left at
Florence no picture in public; he there taught no pupil; and it appears
that he retained Salai, whom I shall notice among the Milanese artists,
in the station of a dependant, during his residence at Florence. In
Florence we meet with pictures in the possession of private individuals,
that seem the work of Vinci; and sometimes the dealers extol them as
his, gravely adding that they cost a large sum. Such pieces are probably
the productions of Salai, or of other imitators of Lionardo, who availed
themselves of his cartoons, his drawings, or his few paintings. We are
informed that Lorenzo di Credi, whose family name was Sciarpelloni, made
use of them more than any other Florentine. Educated, as well as Vinci,
in the school of Verrocchio, he followed rules nearly similar; he was
patient, and aimed at the same object; but he approached less closely to
the softness of the moderns. He copied, with such precision, a picture
by Lionardo, which was sent to Spain, that the copy was not
distinguishable from the original. Private houses contain many of his
circular Holy Families, of which the invention and gracefulness remind
us of Lionardo. I possess one which represents the Virgin sitting with
Christ in her arms, and at her side <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>the young S. John, to
whom she turns as if to lay hold of him, at which the child seems timid,
and draws back: it is in a lovely manner; but the style is not well
suited to such a subject. Some of Credi's pictures, which Bottari did
not meet with in public places, are now exhibited; as the Magdalen with
S. Nicholas and S. Julian, adduced by Vasari as an example of a
picturesque and highly finished style. His Christ in the manger may be
also seen at S. Chiara; and it is one of his finest pictures, for the
beauty of the faces, the vigour of expression, the finish of the
back-ground, and the good colouring of the whole. Both in this, and in
his other original pictures, we may discern some imitation of Vinci, and
of Pietro Perugino, another friend of Credi: he possesses, however, some
originality, which his scholar, Giovanni Antonio Sogliani, successfully
imitated and improved.</p>

<p>This artist lived twenty-four years with Lorenzo; and in imitation of
his model was contented to paint less than his contemporaries, that he
might do it better. He likewise attempted to imitate Porta; but his
natural disposition led him rather to follow the simple grace of his
instructor, than the sublimity of this master. Few of this school can
compare with him for the natural appearance he gave the naked as well as
the clothed figure, or for the conception of "handsome, good-natured,
sweet, and graceful features."<a name="fnanchor_135"
id="fnanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
Like Lionardo, he possessed the rare talent of representing images of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg
160]</a></span>virtue by the faces of his saints, and of vice by those
of his wicked characters. This is exemplified in his Cain and Abel, in
the cathedral of Pisa, where he has introduced a landscape, that of
itself would do honour to any painter. With equal felicity in the figure
and the back-ground, he painted the crucifixion of S. Arcadius, which
was brought from another church to that of S. Lorenzo at Florence, where
it still remains. He entered into competition with Perino del Vaga, with
Mecherino, and Andrea del Sarto, at Pisa, where he was noted for his
dilatoriness, but admired for that happy simplicity and elegance which
he always preserved. Some have praised a few of his pictures as
inclining to the manner of Raffaello, a commendation also bestowed on
Luini, and other followers of Lionardo. He had pupils who afterwards
followed other masters: but a Zanobi di Poggino, who painted many
pictures for Florence, which are now unknown, appears to have had no
other master.</p>

<p>One of the best imitators of Vinci, almost equal to Luini himself,
may be recognized in the sacristy of S. Stephen, at Bologna, in which
there is a S. John in the <ins title="'Desart' in the
original">Desert</ins>, with the inscription <i>Jul. Flor.</i> If this
be read <i>Julius Florentinus</i>, the artist is unknown; but perhaps we
should read <i>Julianus</i>, and ascribe it to Bugiardini. We are
informed by Vasari that he was at Bologna, and that he painted a Madonna
between two Saints, for the church of S. Francis; where it still is, and
approaches the style of Lionardo fully as much as any other manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg
161]</a></span>Both pictures, on comparing the style, seem the work of
the same artist; and to this artist also belongs a Nativity, in the
cloister of the canons of S. Salvatore; and various pictures that may be
found in some private houses with a similar epigraph. If we embrace the
opinion of Vasari, we must consider Giuliano as a feeble painter, but
uncommonly careful, and consequently slow. We should rather suppose him
the imitator of any other artist than of Vinci; for he is described as
the fellow student of Bonarruoti, the assistant of Albertinelli, and the
colourist of some works of Fra Bartolommeo. One can readily perceive
that Vasari was wrong, as in many other instances, in his slight
estimation of this artist, on which account he has not paid a due
attention to his works or to his style. He has represented this man as
amiable in disposition, as a picture of contented poverty, as also an
unbounded admirer of his Madonnas, and very profuse in his own
commendations; qualities which rendered him highly amusing even to
Michelangiolo. Intent on amusing his reader with the character of the
man, he has not perhaps sufficiently rated the merits of the artist.
This is proved by the little respect with which he mentions the
martyrdom of S. Catherine in S. Maria Novella, which Bottari has called
"a work worthy of admiration," not only for the figures of the soldiers,
which, as Giuliano found himself unequal to the performance, were
outlined with charcoal by Michelangiolo, and afterwards painted by
Giuliano; but for the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162"
id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>other parts of the story. The truth
seems to be, that he had not much invention, and did not adhere to one
style; but now and then borrowed a thought; as in the Nativity already
noticed, where one may recognize the style of Fra Bartolommeo. On
considering each figure separately, he appears on the whole happy in his
imitations, especially in Bologna, where the S. John is held in the
highest esteem. In Florence he painted many Madonnas and Holy Families,
which, with the aid of the Bolognese pictures, may perhaps be recognized
as his by their clearness, the masculine and somewhat heavy proportions,
and the mouths sometimes expressive of melancholy; although the subject
did not properly call for it. One of these is to be seen in the
collection of the noble family Orlandini.</p>

<p>Michelangiolo Bonarruoti, of whom memoirs were published by two of
his disciples while he was still living,<a name="fnanchor_136"
id="fnanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
was born twenty-three years after Lionardo da Vinci. Like him he was
endowed with a ready wit, and consummate eloquence. His bon mots rival
those of the Grecian painters, which are recorded by Dati, and he is
even esteemed the most witty and lively of his race. He possessed not
the polish and elegance of Vinci, but his genius was more vast and
daring. Hence he attained the three sister arts in an eminent degree,
and has left specimens in painting, sculpture, and architecture,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
sufficient to immortalize three different artists. Like Vinci he gave
proofs of talent in his boyish years, that compelled his master to
confess his own inferiority. This master was Domenico Ghirlandaio, who
sent his own brother Benedetto to paint in France, from jealousy of his
preeminence; and, perhaps, fearing the wonderful powers of Bonarruoti,
turned his attention to sculpture. Lorenzo the Magnificent, desirous of
encouraging the statuary art, which was on the decline in his country,
had collected in his gardens, adjacent to the monastery of S. Mark, many
antique marbles; and committing the care of them to Bertoldo, a scholar
of Donatello, he requested of Ghirlandaio some young man to be there
educated as a sculptor; and this artist sent him Michelangiolo. This
transaction was disliked by his father, Lodovico, in whose mind the art
appeared degrading to his high birth; but he had no reason to repent it.
On obtaining his object, Lorenzo not only added to the fortune of
Lodovico, but retained Michelangiolo in his house, rather as a relation
than a dependant, placing him at the same table with his own sons, with
Poliziano, and other learned men who then graced his residence. During
the four years that he remained there he laid the foundation of all his
acquirements; he especially studied poetry, and thus was enabled to
rival Vinci in his Sonnets, and to relish Dante, a bard of a sublimity
beyond the reach of vulgar souls.<a name="fnanchor_137"
id="fnanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
Bonarruoti studied <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164"
id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>design in the chapel of Masaccio, he
copied the antiques in the garden of Lorenzo, and attended to anatomy, a
science, to which he is said to have dedicated twelve years, with great
injury to his health, and which determined his style, his practice, and
his glory.<a name="fnanchor_138" id="fnanchor_138"></a><a
href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> To this study he owed
that style from which he obtained the name of the Dante of the art. As
this poet made choice of materials very difficult to be reduced to
verse, and from an abstruse subject extracted the praise of sublimity
and grandeur, in like manner Michelangiolo explored the untrodden path
of design, and in pursuing it, displayed powers of execution at once
scientific and magnificent. In his works, man assumes that form which,
according to Quintilian,<a name="fnanchor_139" id="fnanchor_139"></a><a
href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Zeuxis delighted to
represent; nervous, muscular, and robust: his foreshortenings, and his
attitudes are most daring; his expression full of vivacity and energy.
The poet and the painter have other<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> points of resemblance;
a display of knowledge, from which Dante appears sometimes to critics, a
declaimer rather than a poet, Bonarruoti, an anatomist rather than a
painter; a neglect of elegance, from which the first often, and, if we
subscribe to the opinions of the Caracci and of Mengs, the second
sometimes, degenerated into harshness.<a name="fnanchor_140"
id="fnanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
On points like these, which depend wholly on taste, I shall not decide,
but content myself with warning the reader that such comparisons should
not be pushed too far: for this poet, from his desire of surmounting
difficulties in conception and versification, has sometimes so deviated
from the usual path, that he cannot always be proposed as a model for
imitation: but every design of Michelangiolo, every sketch, as well as
his more finished works, may be regarded as a model in art; if in Dante
we trace marks of labour, in Michelangiolo every thing exhibits nature
and facility.<a name="fnanchor_141" id="fnanchor_141"></a><a
href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> It was one of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>his
observations, that the compasses ought to lie in the eyes; a principle
apparently drawn from Diodorus Siculus, where he asserts that the
Egyptians had the rules of measurement in their hands; the Greeks in
their eyes.<a name="fnanchor_142" id="fnanchor_142"></a><a
href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Nor is such eulogy
inapplicable to our artist; who, whether he handled his pen, his chisel,
or a piece of charcoal, even in sport, still displayed infallible skill
in every part of his design.</p>

<p>Bonarruoti was extolled to the skies by Ariosto for his painting, as
well as for his sculpture;<a name="fnanchor_143"
id="fnanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
but Condivi and others prefer his chisel to his pencil; and he
undoubtedly exercised it more professedly and with greater reputation.
His Moses on the tomb of Julius II. in the church of S. Pietro in
Vincoli, his Christ in the Minerva, his Piety in S. Pietro Vaticano, and
the statues in the church of S. Lorenzo at Florence, and in the ducal
palaces, must be acknowledged to be the finest specimens of sculpture,
in themselves forming schools of the revived art. I will not extol them
so highly as Vasari does the colossal David, placed near the Palazzo
Vecchio, when he says "that it bore away the palm from every statue,
modern or ancient, either Grecian <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>or Roman;" nor shall I
follow his annotator, Bottari, in whose judgment Bonarruoti has greatly
surpassed the Greeks, who are not so successful in statues larger than
the life. I have heard competent judges remark, that we do an injury to
the Grecian masters, not only by preferring any modern to them, but even
by comparing them; but my pen ought not to wander too far from the
canvass and from colouring.</p>

<p>The few remaining drawings of Michelangiolo demonstrate how little he
painted. Conscious of his superiority in sculpture, he seems to have
dreaded appearing as a second or a third-rate painter. The majority of
his compositions that have reached our time, like those of Vinci, are
mere outlines; and therefore, though many cabinets are rich in his
drawings, none can boast the possession of his paintings. The cartoon of
the battle of Pisa, prepared for a competition with Vinci in the saloon
of the public palace at Florence, is said to have been a wonderful
production in this species of art. Mariette supposes, in the letter
above quoted, that the example of Vinci paved the way for this great
undertaking, which he confesses surpassed the original. Michelangiolo
did not rest satisfied with representing the Florentines cased in
armour, and mingling with their enemies; but choosing the moment of the
attack upon their van, while bathing in the river Arno, he seized the
opportunity of representing many naked figures, as they rushed to arms
from the water; by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168"
id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>which he was enabled to introduce a
prodigious variety of foreshortenings, attitudes the most energetic, in
a word, the highest perfection of his peculiar excellences. Cellini
observes in the thirteenth chapter of his life, that when Michelangiolo
"painted the chapel of Pope Julius, he reached not half that dignity;"
and Vasari adds, that "all the artists who studied and designed after
this cartoon, became eminent;" among these he reckons the best
Florentine artists of the second epoch, from the time of Frate, and to
them he joined Raffaello d'Urbino. This is a point of critical
disquisition not yet sufficiently cleared up, though much has been
written both for and against the opinion of Vasari. I am not of the
number of those who suppose that the labours of Bonarruoti had no
influence on the style of Raffaello, because it appears dissimilar. It
would seem to me an act of injustice to this divine genius, to imagine
that profiting as he did by the finest productions of the art, he
neglected those sources of information. I therefore firmly believe, that
Raffaello likewise studied Michelangiolo, which he himself appears to
acknowledge, as I shall afterwards relate. I cannot, however, grant to
Vasari that he saw this cartoon on his first short visit to Florence.<a
name="fnanchor_144" id="fnanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144"
class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg
169]</a></span>This cartoon has perished, and report accuses Baccio
Bandinelli of tearing it in pieces, either that others might not derive
advantage from viewing it, or because from partiality to Vinci, and
hatred to Bonarruoti, he wished to remove a subject of comparison, that
might exalt the reputation of the latter above that of Lionardo. This
circumstance is not authenticated, nor are we much interested in the
supposed criminal, who though eminent as a designer and a sculptor,
painted a very few pieces, that may almost all be reduced to an Ebriety
of Noah, and the Imprisonment of the Fathers of the Church. Baccio soon
renounced the pencil, and Michelangiolo appears to have done the same,
for he was called to Rome by Julius II. as a sculptor, and when the
Pope, about 1508, asked him to paint the ceiling of the chapel, he
declined it, and wished to transfer the commission to Raffaello.</p>

<p>He was, however, constrained to undertake it, and, unaccustomed to
work in fresco, he invited some of the best painters in this branch from
Florence,<a name="fnanchor_145" id="fnanchor_145"></a><a
href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> that they might assist,
or rather that they <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170"
id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>might instruct him. When he had
acquired what he deemed necessary, he effaced their labours entirely,
and set about the work without an assistant. When the task was about
half finished, he exhibited it for a little time to the public. He then
applied himself to the other part, but proceeding more slowly than the
impatience of the pontiff could endure, he was compelled by threats to
use quicker despatch, and without assistance finished the greater part,
then incomplete, in twenty months. I have said that he was unaided, for
such was the delicacy of his taste, that no artist could please him; and
as in sculpture, every piercer, file, and chisel, which he used, was the
work of his own hands, so in painting, "he prepared his own colours, and
did not commit the mixing and other necessary manipulations to mechanics
or to boys."<a name="fnanchor_146" id="fnanchor_146"></a><a
href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Here may be seen those
grand and finely varied figures of the Prophets and the Sybils, the
style of which is pronounced by Lomazzo, an impartial judge, because an
artist of a different school, "to be the finest in the world."<a
name="fnanchor_147" id="fnanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147"
class="fnanchor">[147]</a> There, indeed, the dignity of the aspects,
the solemn majesty of the eyes, a certain wild and uncommon casting of
the drapery, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171"
id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> the attitudes, whether representing
rest or motion, announce an order of beings who hold converse with the
Deity, and whose mouths utter what he inspires. Amid this display of
genius, the figure most admired by Vasari is that of Isaiah, "who,
absorbed in meditation, places his right hand in a book, to denote where
he had been reading; and with his left elbow on the book, and his cheek
resting on that hand, he turns round his head, without moving the rest
of his body, on being called by one of the children that are behind him;
a figure which, if attentively studied, might fully teach the precepts
of a master." No less science is displayed in his pictures of the
Creation of the World, of the Deluge, of Judith, and in the other
compartments of that vast ceiling. All is varied and fanciful in the
garments, the foreshortenings, and the attitudes: all is novel in the
composition and the designs. He that contemplates the pictures of Sandro
and his associates on the walls, and then, raising his eyes to the
ceiling, beholds Michelangiolo "soaring like an eagle above them all,"
can hardly believe that a man, not exercised in painting, in what may be
considered as his first essay, should so nearly approach the greatest
masters of antiquity, and thus open a new career to modern artists.</p>

<p>In the succeeding pontificates, Michelangiolo, always occupied in
sculpture and architecture, almost wholly abandoned painting, till he
was induced <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg
172]</a></span>by Paul III. to resume the pencil. Clement VII. had
conceived the design of employing him in the Sistine Chapel on two other
grand historical pictures; the Fall of the Angels, over the gate, and
the Last Judgment, in the opposite façade, over the altar. Michelangiolo
had composed designs for the Last Judgment, and Paul III. being aware of
this, commanded, or rather entreated him, to commence the work; for he
went to the house of Michelangiolo, accompanied by ten Cardinals, an
honour, except in this instance, unknown in the annals of the art. On
the suggestion of F. Sebastiano del Piombo, he was desirous that the
picture should be painted in oil; but this he could not procure, for
Michelangiolo replied, that he would not undertake it except in fresco,
and that oil painting was employment only fit for women, or idlers of
mean capacity. He caused the plaister prepared by Frate to be thrown
down, and substituting a rough-cast suited to his purpose, he completed
the work in eight years, and exhibited it in 1541. If in the ceiling of
the chapel he could not fully satisfy himself, and was unable to retouch
it as he wished to do after it was dry, in this immense painting he had
an opportunity of fulfilling his intentions, and of demonstrating to the
full the powers of his genius. He peopled this space, and disposed
innumerable figures awakened by the sound of the last trumpet; bands of
angels and of devils, of elected and condemned souls:<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
some of them rising from the tomb, others standing on the earth; some
flying to the regions of bliss, while others are dragged down to
punishment.</p>

<p>Bottari observes<a name="fnanchor_148" id="fnanchor_148"></a><a
href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> that there have been
some who affected to depreciate this picture, on comparing it with the
works of other artists, by remarking how much he might have added to the
expression, to the colouring, or to the beauty of the contours: but
Lomazzo, Felibien,<a name="fnanchor_149" id="fnanchor_149"></a><a
href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and several others, have
not failed on that account to acknowledge him supreme in that peculiar
branch of the profession, at which he aimed in all his works, and
especially in this of his Last Judgment. The subject itself appeared
rather created than selected by him. To a genius so comprehensive, and
so skilled in drawing the human figure, no subject could be better
adapted than the Resurrection; to an artist who delighted in the awful,
no story more suitable than the day of supernal terrors. He saw
Raffaello pre-eminent in every other department of the art: he foresaw
that in this alone could he expect to be triumphant; and, perhaps, he
indulged the hope also that posterity would adjudge the palm to him who
excelled all others in the most arduous walk of art. Vasari, his
confidant, and the participator of his thoughts, seems to hint at
something of this sort in two passages in his Life of Michelangiolo.<a
name="fnanchor_150" id="fnanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150"
class="fnanchor">[150]</a> He informs us, "that applying himself to the
human <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg
174]</a></span>figure, the great object of art, he neglected the
attractions of colouring, all sporting of the pencil, and fantastic
novelty:" and again, "neither landscapes, trees, nor houses, are to be
seen in it, and we even look in vain for some degree of variety and
ornament, which are never attempted, probably because he disdained to
submit his towering genius to such objects." I cannot suppose in
Michelangiolo such arrogance, nor such negligence of his own improvement
in an art which embraces every object in nature, that he would limit
himself to the naked figure, which is a single branch, and to one only
character, his own sublime and awful manner. I rather imagine, that
discovering his strength in this style, he did not attempt any other.
There he proceeded as in his peculiar province, and, what one cannot
wholly commend, he observed no limits, and wished for no control. This
Last Judgment was filled with such a profusion of nudity, that it was in
great danger of being destroyed: from a regard to the decency of the
sanctuary, Paul IV. proposed to white-wash it, and was hardly appeased
with the correction of its most glaring indelicacies, by some drapery
introduced here and there by Daniel da Volterra, on whom the facetious
Romans, from this circumstance, conferred the nick-name of the
<i>Breeches-maker</i>.<a name="fnanchor_151" id="fnanchor_151"></a><a
href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Other corrections have been proposed in it by different critics, both
with regard to the costume and the conception. The artist has been
censured <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg
175]</a></span>for confounding sacred with profane history; for
introducing the angels of Revelation with the Stygian ferryman; Christ
sitting in judgment, and Minos, who assigns his proper station to each
of the damned. To this profanity he added satire, by pourtraying in
Minos the features of a master of the ceremonies, who, in the hearing of
the Pope, had pronounced this picture more suitable for a bagnio than a
church;<a name="fnanchor_152" id="fnanchor_152"></a><a
href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> but Bonarruoti did not
set the example in such composition. Scannelli has expressed a wish that
there had been greater variety in the proportion, and muscularity
according to the diversity of age;<a name="fnanchor_153"
id="fnanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
although, by an evident anachronism, this criticism is attributed to
Vinci, who died in 1519. Albani, as quoted by Malvasia,<a
name="fnanchor_154" id="fnanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154"
class="fnanchor">[154]</a> says, that "had Michelangiolo contemplated
Raffaello, he might have learned to dispose the crowd that surround the
judgment-seat of Christ in a superior manner;" but here I am uncertain
whether he blames the composition or the perspective.<a
name="fnanchor_155" id="fnanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155"
class="fnanchor">[155]</a> I can discover, however, an anachronism in
his imagining the Last Judgment an earlier work than it really is by
many years; as if it had been executed before Raffaello came to
Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg
176]</a></span>I find that Albani rendered justice to the merit of
Michelangiolo; he reckoned not three great masters in painting only, as
is now commonly done; but he added a fourth, and thought that Bonarruoti
surpassed Raffaello, Tiziano, and Coreggio, "in form and in grandeur."<a
name="fnanchor_156" id="fnanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156"
class="fnanchor">[156]</a> We may here observe, that when Michelangiolo
was so inclined, he could obtain distinction for those endowments in
which the others excelled. It is a vulgar error to suppose that he had
no idea of grace and beauty; the Eve of the Sistine Chapel turns to
thank her maker, on her creation, with an attitude so fine and lovely,
that it would do honour to the school of Raffaello. Annibale Caracci
admired this, and many other naked figures in this grand ceiling, so
highly, that he proposed them to himself as models in the art, and
according to Bellori,<a name="fnanchor_157" id="fnanchor_157"></a><a
href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> preferred them to those
of the Last Judgment, that appeared to him too anatomical. In
chiaroscuro Michelangiolo had not the skill and delicacy of Coreggio;
but the paintings of the Vatican have a force and relief much commended
by Renfesthein, an eminent connoisseur, who, on passing from the Sistine
Chapel to the Farnesian gallery, remarked how greatly in this respect
the Caracci themselves were eclipsed by Bonarruoti. Dolce speaks less
favourably of his colouring,<a name="fnanchor_158"
id="fnanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
for this author was captivated by Tiziano and the Venetian school: no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg
177]</a></span>one, however, can deny that the colouring of
Michelangiolo in this chapel is admirably adapted to the design,<a
name="fnanchor_159" id="fnanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159"
class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and the same, also, would have been the case
with his two pictures in the Pauline Chapel, the Crucifixion of S. Peter
and the Conversion of S. Paul, but they have sustained great injury from
time.</p>

<p>None of his paintings are to be seen in public, except in those two
chapels; and those described as his in collections, are almost all the
works of other hands. During his residence at Florence he painted an
exquisite Leda for Alphonso, Duke of Ferrara, to whom however it was not
sold. Michelangiolo, offended at the manner in which it was demanded by
one of the courtiers of that prince, refused to let him have it: but
made a present of it to his pupil, Antonio Mini, who carried it to
France. Vasari describes it as "a grand picture, painted in distemper,
that seemed as if breathed on the canvass;" and Mariette affirms, in his
notes on Condivi, that he saw the picture in a damaged state, and that
it appeared as if Michelangiolo had there forgot his usual style, and
"approached the tone of Tiziano." This expression inclines one to
suspect that he is describing a copy taken in oil by some able painter;
especially as D'Argenville informs us that this painting was burnt in
the reign of Louis XIII. It is said there is also one of his pictures,
representing the Virgin and the Divine Infant, in an upright position,
standing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg
178]</a></span>near the cradle upon a rock, a figure drawn of the size
of nature, formerly in possession of the noble house of Mocci (Mozzi) at
Florence; and afterwards transferred to the cathedral of Burgos, where
it still remains.<a name="fnanchor_160" id="fnanchor_160"></a><a
href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Michelangiolo executed
likewise a circular Holy Family, with some naked figures in the
distance, for Agnol Doni. It is now in the tribune of the Florentine
gallery, in a high state of preservation. It is praised by Richardson
and some others for the vigour of its tints, and is painted in
distemper. Placed among the works of the greatest masters of every
school that vie with each other in this theatre of art, it appears the
most scientific, but the least pleasing picture: its author seems the
most powerful designer, but the feeblest colourist among them all. In it
aerial perspective is neglected, inasmuch as the figures are not
indistinct in proportion to their diminution, a fault not uncommon in
that age. I cannot so readily decide whether his style appears in
certain pictures that are described as his in several collections in
Florence, Rome, and Bologna, as well as in the catalogue of the imperial
gallery at Vienna, and in the royal collections in Spain, that represent
the subjects of the Crucifixion,<a name="fnanchor_161"
id="fnanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg
179]</a></span>the Pietà,<a name="fnanchor_162" id="fnanchor_162"></a><a
href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> the Infant Jesus asleep,
and the Prayer in the Garden. They resemble the design of Michelangiolo,
but their execution betrays another pencil. This is rendered probable by
the silence of Vasari; their high finish seems incredible in an artist,
who, even in sculpture, very rarely attempted it; and our scepticism is
confirmed by the opinion of Mengs, and other competent judges, whom I
have consulted to elucidate this point. Some of them, in which the
distribution of the tints was perhaps originally made under his
inspection, resemble his style. These may have been copied by
Fiamminghi, as the tints of some of them indicate, or by other Italian
artists of the various schools, since they differ so much in their mode
of colouring. Some copies may be the work of the scholars of
Michelangiolo, though Vasari informs us they were all but feeble
artists. He gives us the names of those who dwelt in his house; Pietro
Urbano of Pistoia, a man of genius, but very indolent; Antonio Mini of
Florence, and Ascanio Condivi da Ripatransone, both eager in their
profession, but of little talent, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>and therefore the
authors of no work worthy of record. The people of Ferrara include their
countryman Filippi in this school, an artist unknown to Vasari, but
worthy of notice. Lomazzi mentions Marco da Pino as one of the number.
To these Palomino adds Castelli of Bergamo, (whose master, while he was
in Rome, is not noticed by any of our writers) and Gaspar Bacerra, of
Andalusia, a celebrated Spanish painter. We may likewise add Alonzo
Berrugese, who is reckoned by Vasari only among those that studied the
cartoon of Michelangiolo, at Florence, with Francia, and other
strangers, who were not among his disciples. In the history of Spanish
painting, there is mentioned by all the writers a Roman, of the name of
Matteo Perez d'Alessio, or d'Alessi. They recount that he lived many
years at Seville, and produced many works there, among which his S.
Cristoforo, in the cathedral, which cost 4,000 crowns, is by far the
grandest. They add, that Luigi Vargas, a very able disciple of Perino
del Vaga, having returned from Rome, Alessi was glad to leave the field
open to him, and to return into Italy; where Preziado finds him. Indeed
he rather finds him at Rome, and at the Sistine Chapel, where two
histories, painted "opposite to the Last Judgment of his master," are
ascribed to him; these however are the production of Matteo da Leccio,
who aimed at imitating Michelangiolo and Salviati; but he is only
despised by Taia, and by every one who has a grain of sense. He executed
this work in the time of Gregory XIII.; and neither he nor the
supposititious Alessio,<a name="fnanchor_163" id="fnanchor_163"></a><a
href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>an imaginary name, had
any connexion with Michelangiolo. The rest we refer to the note, in
order to proceed without delay to names which may boast a better title
to such a connexion.</p>

<p>Many other figures and historic compositions were designed by
Michelangiolo, and painted at Rome by F. Sebastiano del Piombo, an
excellent colourist of the Venetian school. The Pietà in the church of
S. Francis of Viterbo,<a name="fnanchor_164" id="fnanchor_164"></a><a
href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> the Flagellation, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>and
Transfiguration, with some other pieces at S. Pietro in Montorio, are of
this number. Two Annunciations, designed by Bonarruoti, were coloured
for altar-pieces by Marcello Venusti of Mantua, a scholar of Perino, who
adopted the style of Michelangiolo, without apparent affectation. The
one was put up in the church of S. Giovanni Laterano, the other in the
Della Pace. He is said to have painted also some cabinet pictures after
designs of Bonarruoti; as the Limbo,<a name="fnanchor_165"
id="fnanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
in the Colonna palace; the Christ going to Mount Calvary, and some other
pieces in the Borghese; also the celebrated copy of the Last Judgment,
which he painted for Cardinal Farnese, that still exists in Naples.
Although a good designer, and the author of many pieces described by
Baglione, he obtained greater celebrity by clothing the inventions of
Michelangiolo in exquisite beauty, especially in small pictures, of
which, Vasari says, he executed a great many. This writer, and Orlandi
following him, have erroneously named him Raffaello, not Marcello.
Batista Franco coloured the Rape of Ganymede, after a design of
Bonarruoti, which was also done by the artist who painted the small
picture which D'Argenville describes in France; and another on a larger
scale, to be seen at Rome in the possession of the Colonna family: <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>it
was also painted in oil by Giulio Clovio. Pontormo employed himself in a
similar manner at Florence, on the design of Venus and Cupid; and on the
cartoon of Christ appearing to Mary Magdalen, a work which was
re-executed by him for Città di Castello, Bonarruoti having said, that
none could perform it better. Francesco Salviati painted another of his
designs, and Bugiardini, as we have already noticed, executed some
figures designed by him. Such is the information transmitted to us by
Vasari; and he would have been justly reprehensible if he had written
with such minuteness on the drawings of Michelangiolo, and of those
employed to finish them, and had neglected to inform us as to those
pieces which Michelangiolo himself executed. Hence it is not easy to
avoid scepticism on the genuineness of the Annunciation, the
Flagellation, or any other oil painting ascribed to Bonarruoti by
Bottari, D'Argenville, or the describers of collections. We have noticed
his aversion to this method of painting. We are informed that during his
lifetime he employed others in this branch; and we know that after his
death artists availed themselves of his designs; as Sabbatini did in a
Pietà for the sacristy of the Church of S. Peter, a work copied by some
other artist for the Madonna de' Monti, and some others made known to us
by Baglione. Can we then hesitate as to the originality of any picture,
if we give credit to the oil paintings of Michelangiolo? The portraits
of Bonarruoti ascribed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184"
id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>to his own hand, are also, in my
opinion, supposititious. Vasari knew of no likeness of him except the
figure cast in bronze by Ricciarelli, and two portraits, the one painted
by Bugiardini, the other by Jacopo del Conte. From these are derived the
very old and well known portraits, preserved in the ducal gallery, in
the collection of the Capitol, in the Caprara palace at Bologna, and
that in the possession of Cardinal Zelada at Rome.</p>

<p>Franco, Marco da Siena, Tibaldi, and other foreign artists, who have
imitated Michelangiolo, shall be noticed under their respective schools.
The Florentine school abounded in them, and these we shall consider all
together in the succeeding epoch. I shall here only notice two, who
lived on intimate habits with him, who executed works under his own eye,
and for a long time received directions from his own lips; circumstances
which cannot be said of Vasari, of Salviati, nor of any other able
artist of his school. One of these was Francesco Granacci of Florence,
characterized by Vasari as an excellent artist, who derived much of his
merit from his early intimacy with Michelangiolo. He was the fellow
student of the latter, under Domenico Ghirlandaio, and also in the
garden of Lorenzo; and from his precepts, and by studying his cartoon,
he enlarged his own manner, and approached near the modern style. After
the death of his master, he remained with the brothers of that artist,
to complete some of the works of the deceased, and was employed in
painting some Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185"
id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> Families, and cabinet pictures, in
distemper, which might easily pass under another name, as they resemble
the best productions of that school. In his new style he never entirely
abandoned the simplicity of the old manner; but there is a specimen in
the church of S. Jacopo without-the-walls, more studied in design, and
more determined in the colouring. In this picture S. Zanobi and S.
Francis appear near our Lady under a lofty canopy; a subject then
familiar in every school. His style seems more matured in an Assumption
which was in S. Pier Maggiore, a church now suppressed: here he
inserted, between two other figures, a S. Thomas, wholly in the manner
of Michelangiolo. Few other considerable paintings can be ascribed to
this artist, who was left in easy circumstances by his father, and
painted rather as a commendable amusement than from necessity.</p>

<p>Ricciarelli, usually known in history by the name of Daniele di
Volterra, enjoys a greater name, and is generally described as the most
successful follower of Michelangiolo. Educated in Siena, according to
report, by Peruzzi and Razzi, he became the assistant of Perino del
Vaga, and acquired an astonishing talent for imitating Bonarruoti, who
greatly esteemed him, appointed him his substitute in the labours of the
Vatican, brought him into notice, and assisted and enriched him with
designs. It is known that Michelangiolo was often with Daniele when he
painted in the Farnese palace, and it is said that Bonarruoti, during
his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg
186]</a></span>absence, "O vero o falso che la fama suoni," mounted the
scaffold, and sketched with charcoal a colossal head that is still seen
there. Volterra let it remain, that posterity might judge of the powers
of Bonarruoti, who without pre-meditation and in mere jest, had finished
a work in such proportion, and so perfect. Nor did Daniele execute,
without the assistance of Michelangiolo, the wonderful Descent from the
Cross in the Trinità de' Monti, which, together with the Transfiguration
by Raffaello, and the S. Girolamo of Domenichino, may be reckoned among
the finest paintings in Rome.<a name="fnanchor_166"
id="fnanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
We seem to behold the mournful spectacle, and the Redeemer sinking with
the natural relaxation of a dead body in descending: the pious men
engaged in various offices, and thrown in different and contrasted
attitudes, appear assiduously occupied with the sacred remains which
they seem to venerate; the mother of Jesus having fainted between the
sorrowing women, the beloved disciple extends his arms and bends over
her. There is a truth in the naked figures that seems perfect nature; a
colouring in the faces and the whole piece that suits the subject, and
is more determined than delicate; a relief, a harmony, and, in a word, a
skill that might do honour to the hand of Michelangiolo himself, had the
picture been inscribed with his name. To this the artist, I believe,
alluded, when he painted Bonarruoti with a mirror near it; as if <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>in
this picture he might behold a reflection of himself. Volterra painted
some other Crucifixions in the Orsini Chapel, where he was employed for
seven years; but they are inferior to that described above. He employed
his pupils in another chapel of that church, (Michele Alberti, according
to the Guide to Rome, and Gio. Paolo Rossetti,) and supplied them with
designs; one of which he himself executed in a picture, with figures of
a moderate size. The subject is the Murder of the Innocents, and it is
now deposited in the Tribune of the Royal Gallery of Florence; an honour
that speaks more for it than my eulogy. The Grand Duke Leopold purchased
it at a high price from a church in Volterra, where there is now no
other public specimen of this master. The Ricciarelli family possess a
fine Elijah, as an inheritance and memorial of this great man; and a
beautiful fresco remains in a study in the house of the Dottor Mazzoni,
relating to which we may refer the reader to the excellent
historiographer of Volterra, (tom. i. p. 177).</p>

<p>There was a youth of Florence, named Baccio della Porta, because his
study was near a gate of that city; but having become a Dominican, he
obtained that of Fra Bartolommeo di S. Marco, from the convent where he
resided, or, more shortly, that of Frate. Whilst he studied under
Rosselli, he became enamoured of the grand <i>chiaro-scuro</i> of Vinci,
and emulated him assiduously. We read that his friend Albertinelli
studied modelling, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188"
id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> copied ancient basso-relievos, from a
desire of obtaining correctness in his shadows; and we may conjecture
the same of Baccio, although Vasari is silent on this head. The Prince
has a Nativity and Circumcision of Christ in his early manner; most
graceful little pictures, resembling miniatures. About this period he
also painted his own portrait in the lay habit, a full-length figure,
most skilfully inclosed in a small space, and now in the splendid
collection of the Signori Montecatini at Lucca. He entered the cloister
in 1500, at the age of thirty-one, and for four years never handled the
pencil. The execution of Savonarola, whom he knew and respected, preyed
upon his mind; and, like Botticelli and Credi, he gave up the art. When
he again resumed it, he seems to have advanced daily in improvement,
during the last thirteen or fourteen years of his life; so that his
earlier productions, though very beautiful, are inferior to his last.
His improvement was accelerated by Raffaello, who came to Florence to
pursue his studies in 1504, contracted a friendship for him, and was at
the same time his scholar in colouring, and his master in perspective.<a
name="fnanchor_167" id="fnanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167"
class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Having gone to Rome some years after, to see
the works of Bonarruoti and Raffaello, if I am not deceived, he greatly
elevated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg
189]</a></span>his style; but his manner was at all times more
conformable to that of his friend than of his fellow citizen, uniting
dignity with grace in his heads and in his general design. The picture
in the Pitti palace is a proof of this, which Pietro da Cortona imagined
to be the work of Raffaello, though Frate had painted it before he went
to Rome. In that place he appeared with diminished lustre, says the
historian, in the presence of those two great luminaries of the art, and
speedily returned to Florence; a circumstance which also happened to
Andrea del Sarto, to Rosso, and to other truly eminent masters, whose
modesty was equal to the confidence of innumerable artists of
mediocrity, who frequently enjoyed at Rome much ill placed patronage.
Frate left there two figures of the Chief Apostles, that are preserved
in the Quirinal palace; the S. Peter, which was not finished, had its
last touches from the hand of Raffaello. One of his pictures is also in
the Vatican palace, where it was deposited by Pius VI., with many other
choice paintings. A Holy Family exists in the Corsini collection by the
same hand, and is perhaps his finest and most graceful performance.</p>

<p>His most finished productions are in Tuscany, which boasts various
altar-pieces, and all of them very valuable. Their composition is in the
usual style of the age, which may be observed in the production of every
school, not even excepting Raffaello, and which continued in the
Florentine until the time of Pontormo; viz. a Madonna seated, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>with
an infant Jesus, and accompanied by saints. But in this hackneyed
subject, Frate distinguished himself by grand architecture, by
magnificent flights of steps, and by the skilful grouping of his saints
and cherubims. He introduces them, one while seated in concert, another
time poised on their wings to minister to their king and queen; of whom
some support the drapery, others have charge of the pavilion, a rich and
happily conceived ornament, which he readily connected with such
thrones, even in cabinet pictures. He departed from this mode of
composition in a picture that he left at S. Romano of Lucca, called
Madonna della Misericordia, who sits in an attitude full of grace, amid
a crowd of devotees, shielding them with her mantle from the wrath of
heaven. His rivals occasioned the production of two more altar-pieces:
according to the example of other eminent men, he answered their sneers
by his classic performances; a retort the most galling to the invidious.
They had stigmatized him as unequal to large proportions; and he filled
a large piece with a single figure of S. Mark, which is admired as a
prodigy of art in the ducal gallery, and is described by a learned
foreigner as a Grecian statue transformed into a picture. He was accused
of being ignorant of the anatomy of the human figure; and to refute this
calumny he introduced a naked S. Sebastian in another picture, which was
so perfect in drawing and in colouring, that "it received the unbounded
applause of artists;" but becoming too much the admiration <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>of
the female devotees of that church, it was first removed by the fathers
into a private room, and was afterwards sold, and sent into France.</p>

<p>To sum up all, he knew how to excel at pleasure, in every department
of painting. His design is most chaste, and his youthful faces are more
full and fleshy than was usual with Raffaello; and according to
Algarotti, they are but little elevated above the standard of ordinary
men, and approach to vulgarity. His tints at one period abounded with
shadows produced by lamp black or ivory black, which impairs the value
of some of his pictures; but he gradually acquired a better manner, and,
as we have related, was able to instruct Raffaello. In firmness and
clearness he yields not to the best of the school of Lombardy. He was
the inventor of a new method of casting draperies; having taught the use
of the wooden figure, with moveable joints, that serves admirably for
the study of the folds of drapery. None of his school painted them more
varied and natural, with more breadth, or better adapted to the limbs.
His works are to be seen in several private collections in Florence; but
they are rare beyond the precincts of that city: they are there eagerly
sought after by foreigners, but are very rarely to be sold. One of his
Madonnas was procured within these few years by his Excellency the
Major-Domo of the ducal household, whose collection may be reckoned
another Florentine Gallery in miniature, consisting of about thirty
pictures of the best <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192"
id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>masters of different schools. The
Fathers of S. Mark have a considerable number of his paintings in their
private chapel, and among these is a S. Vincenzo, said by Bottari to
resemble a work of Tiziano or Giorgione. His best and rarest
performances are in the possession of the Prince, in whose collection
the last work of Fra Bartolommeo remains, a large picture in
chiaroscuro, representing the patron saints of the city surrounding the
Virgin Mary. The Gonfalonier Soderini intended this piece for the Hall
of the Council of State; but it was left only as a design at the death
of its author, in 1517, like the projected works of Vinci and
Bonarruoti. It would seem as if some fatality attended the decoration of
this building, which ought to have employed the pencil of the greatest
native artists. Among this number Frate must undoubtedly be included;
and Richardson remarks, that had he possessed the happy combinations of
Raffaello, he, perhaps, would not have been second to that master.<a
name="fnanchor_168" id="fnanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168"
class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The last mentioned production, though
imperfect, is looked upon as a model in the art. The method of this
artist was first to draw the figure naked, then to drape it, and to form
a chiaroscuro, sometimes in oils, that marked the distribution of the
light and shadow, which constituted his great study, and the soul of his
pictures. This large picture demonstrates such preparatives; and it has
as high a value in painting, as the antique plaster models have in
sculpture, in which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193"
id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>Winckelmann discovers the stamp of
genius and compass of design better than in sculptured marbles.</p>

<p>Mariotto Albertinelli, the fellow student and friend of Baccio, the
sharer of his labours and his concerns, emulated his first style, and
approaches to his second in some of his works; but they may be compared
to two streams springing from the same source; the one to become a
brook, the other a mighty river. Some pictures in Florence are supposed
to be their joint performances; and the Marquis Acciaiuoli possesses a
picture of the Assumption, in the upper part of which are the Apostles,
by Baccio, and the lower is deemed the work of Mariotto. He is somewhat
dry in several of his pictures, as in the S. Silvestro, in Monte Cavallo
at Rome; where he also painted a S. Domenick, and a S. Catharine of
Siena, near the throne of the Virgin Mary. He should likewise be known
at Florence. He executed two pictures for the church of S. Giuliano,
remarkable for the force of colouring, and the many imitations of the
style of Frate. The best of all and the nearest to his model is the
Visitation, transferred from the Congregazione de' Preti to the Ducal
gallery, and even to its most honoured place, the Tribune. Albertinelli
obtained great credit by his two pupils, Franciabigio and Innocenzio da
Imola, of whom I shall speak in the proper place as ornaments of their
school. I find Visino praised beyond them both: he painted but little in
Florence, and that in private; but he was much employed in Hungary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg
194]</a></span></p>

<p>Benedetto Cianfanini, Gabriele Rustici, and Cecchin del Frate, who
inherited his master's name, were the scholars of Fra Bartolommeo in his
best time; but they are no longer known by any undoubted works. Fra
Paolo da Pistoia, his colleague, who was honoured in his own country
with a medal, which I have seen, with those of many eminent men of
Pistoia, in the possession of the Sign. Dottor Visoni, obtained the
richest inheritance in all the studies of Baccio; and from his designs
this artist painted many pictures at Pistoia, one of which may be seen
in the parochial church of S. Paul, over the great altar. Those designs
were afterwards carried to Florence, and in the time of Vasari there was
a collection of them at the Dominican convent of S. Catharine, in the
hands of Sister Plautella Nelli. The noble family of this lady possesses
a Crucifixion painted by her, in which there is a multitude of small
figures most highly finished. She seems on the whole a good imitation of
Frate; but she also followed other styles, as may be seen in her
convent. A Descent from the Cross is there shewn, said to be the design
of Andrea del Sarto, but the execution is by her; and likewise an
Epiphany, entirely her own, in which the landscape would do honour to
the modern, but the figures savour of the old school.</p>

<p>Andrea Vannucchi, called Andrea del Sarto, from the occupation of his
father, is commended by Vasari as the first artist of this school, "for
being the most faultless painter of the Florentines,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> for
perfectly understanding the principles of chiaroscuro, for representing
the indistinctness of objects in shadow, and for painting with a
sweetness truly natural: he, moreover, taught how to give a perfect
union to frescos, and in a great measure obviated the necessity of
retouching them when dry, a circumstance which gives all his works the
appearance of having been finished in one day." He is censured by
Baldinucci, as barren in invention; and undoubtedly he wanted that
elevation of conception, which constitutes the epic in painting as well
as in poetry. Deficient in this talent, Andrea is said to have been
modest, elegant, and endued with sensibility; and it appears that he
impressed this character on nature wherever he employed his pencil. The
portico of the Nunziata, transformed by him into a gallery of
inestimable value, is the fittest place to judge of this. Those chaste
outlines that procured him the surname of <i>Andrea the Faultless</i>,
those conceptions of graceful countenances, whose smiles remind us of
the simplicity and grace of Correggio,<a name="fnanchor_169"
id="fnanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
that appropriate architecture, those draperies, adapted to every
condition, and cast with ease, those popular expressions of curiosity,
of astonishment, of confidence, of compassion, and of joy, that never
transgress the bounds of decorum, which are understood at first sight,
and gently affect the mind without <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>agitating it, are
charms that are more readily felt than expressed. He who feels what
Tubules is in poetry, may conceive what Andrea is in painting.</p>

<p>This artist demonstrates the ascendancy of native genius over
precept. When a boy he was put under the tuition of Giovanni Barile, a
good carver in wood, employed on the ceilings and doors of the Vatican,
after the designs of Raffaello, but a painter of no celebrity. While
still a youth, he was consigned to Pier di Cosimo, a practical
colourist, but by no means skilled in drawing or in composition: hence
the taste of Andrea in these arts was formed on the cartoons of Vinci
and Bonarruoti; and, as many circumstances indicate, on the frescos of
Masaccio and of Ghirlandaio, in which the subjects were more suited to
his mild disposition. He went to Rome, but I know not in what year; that
he was there, appears not to me to admit of dispute, as in the case of
Correggio. I do not argue this from his style approaching near to that
of Raffaello, as it appeared also to Lomazzo and other writers, though
with less of ideal beauty. Raffaello and Andrea had studied the same
originals at Florence; and nature might have given them corresponding
ideas for the selection of the beautiful. I ground my opinion entirely
on Vasari. He informs us, that Andrea was at Rome, that seeing the works
of the scholars of Raffaello, timidity induced him to despair of
equalling them, and to return speedily to Florence. If we credit so many
other stories of the pusillanimity of Andrea, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>why should we reject
this? or what faith shall we give to Vasari, if he was erroneous in a
circumstance relating to one who was his master, and which was written
in Florence soon after the death of Andrea, while his scholars, his
friends, and even his wife, were still living, an assertion, too,
uncontradicted in the second edition, in which Vasari retracted so much
of what he had affirmed in the first?</p>

<p>His improvement and his progress from one perfection in art to
another was thus not sudden, as has happened to some other artists; but
was gradually acquired during many years residence at Florence. There,
"by reflecting on what he had seen, he attained such eminence that his
works have been esteemed, and admired, and even more imitated after his
death, than in his lifetime:" so says the historian. This implies that
he improved at Rome; chiefly, however, by his own genius, which led him,
as it were, by the hand, from one step to another, as may be observed in
the Compagnia dello Scalzo, and in the convent of the Servi, where some
of his pictures, executed at different periods, are to be seen. At the
Scalzo, he painted some stories from the life of S. John in chiaroscuro,
the cartoons for which are in the Rinuccini palace: in this work we may
notice some palpable imitations, and even some figures borrowed from
Albert Durer. We may trace his early style in the Baptism of Christ; his
subsequent progress, in some other pictures, as in the Visitation,
painted some years after; and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198"
id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>his greatest excellence and broadest
manner in others, especially in the Birth of the Baptist. In like
manner, the pictures from the life of S. Filippo Benizi, in the lesser
cloister of the Servi, are very beautiful productions, though they are
among the first efforts of Andrea's genius. The Epiphany of our Saviour,
and the Birth of the Virgin in the same place, are more finished works;
but his finest piece is that Holy Family in Repose, which is usually
called <i>Madonna del Sacco</i>, from the sack of grain on which S.
Joseph leans, than which few pictures are more celebrated in the history
of the art. It has frequently been engraved; but after two centuries and
a half, it has at length employed an engraver worthy of it in Morghen,
who has recently executed it, and also a similar composition after
Raffaello. Both prints are in the best collections; and to those who
have not seen either Rome or Florence, Andrea appears rather a rival
than an inferior to the prince of painters. On examining this picture
narrowly, it affords endless scope for observation: it is finished as if
intended for a cabinet; every hair is distinguished, every middle tint
is lowered with consummate art, every outline marked with admirable
variety and grace: and amid all this diligence a facility is
conspicuous, that makes the whole appear natural and unconstrained.</p>

<p>In the ducal palace at Poggio a Caiano, there is a fresco picture of
Cæsar, seated in a hall, ornamented with statues, on a lofty seat, to
whom a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg
199]</a></span>great variety of exotic birds and wild animals are
presented as the tribute of his victories; a work of itself sufficient
to mark Andrea as a painter eminent in perspective, in a knowledge of
the antique, and in every excellence of painting. The order for
ornamenting that palace came from Leo X.; and Andrea, who had there to
contend with Franciabigio and Pontormo, exerted all his energy to please
that encourager of art, and to surpass his competitors. The other
artists seem to have been discouraged, and did not proceed: some years
after Alessandro Allori put a finishing hand to the hall. The royal
palace possesses a treasure in the oil pictures of Andrea. Independent
of the S. Francis, the Assumption, and other pictures, collected by the
family of the Medici, the Grand Duke Leopold purchased a very fine
<i>Pietà</i> from the nuns of Lugo, and placed it in the Tribune as an
honour to the school. The introduction of S. Peter and S. Paul in that
piece, contrary to historical facts, is not the error of the painter who
represented them so admirably, but of those who commissioned the
picture. Critics have remarked a slight defect in the dead Christ, which
they think sustains itself more, and has a greater fulness of the veins,
than is suitable to a dead body: but this is immaterial in a picture the
other parts of which are designed, coloured, and composed, so as to
excite astonishment. A Last Supper, if it were not confined to the
cloisters of the monastery of S. Salvi, would, perhaps, be equally
admired. The soldiers <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200"
id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>who besieged Florence in 1529, and
destroyed the suburbs of the city, undoubtedly admired it: after
demolishing the belfry, the church, and part of the monastery, they were
astonished on beholding this Last Supper, and had not resolution to
destroy it; imitating that Demetrius who, at the siege of Rhodes, is
said to have respected nothing but a picture by Protegenes.<a
name="fnanchor_170" id="fnanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170"
class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Andrea painted a great deal; and on this account is well known beyond
the limits of his own country. Perhaps his best performance in the hands
of strangers is a picture translated to a palace in Genoa from the
church of the Domenicans of Sarzana, who possess several others, very
beautiful. It is composed in the manner of F. Bartolommeo; and besides
the Saints distributed around the Virgin, or on the steps, four of whom
are standing and two on their knees, there are two large figures in the
foreground that seem to start from the lower part of the picture, and
are seen as high as the knee. I am aware that this disposition of the
figures displeases the critics; yet it gives variety in the position of
so many figures, and introduces a great distance between the nearest and
most remote, by which the space seems augmented, and every figure
produces effect. The best collections are not deficient in his Holy
Families. The Marquis Rinuccini, at Florence, possesses two; and some of
the illustrious Romans have even a greater number; but all different,
except <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg
201]</a></span>that the features of the Virgin, which Andrea usually
copied from his wife, have always some resemblance. Many others may be
seen in Rome and in Florence, and not a few in Lombardy, besides those
noticed in the catalogues of foreign nations.</p>

<p>So much genius merited success: and yet if one was to write a book on
the misfortunes of painters, as has already been done on those of
authors, nothing would awaken more compassion than the lot of Andrea.
The poverty of Correggio is exaggerated, or perhaps untrue; the misery
of Domenichino had a termination; the Caracci were ill rewarded, but
lived in easy circumstances. Andrea, from his marriage with Lucrezia del
Fede until his death, was almost always pressed with griefs. In his
first edition, Vasari says, that he was despised by his friends, and
abandoned by his employers, from the time of his marriage with this
woman; that, the slave of her will, he left his father and mother to
starve; that through her arrogance and violence none of the scholars of
Andrea could continue long with him; and this must have happened to
Vasari himself. In the second edition he omitted this censure, either
because he repented of it, or was appeased; but did not, however,
conceal that she was a perpetual source of misfortune to her husband. He
there repeated that Andrea was invited to the French court by Francis I.
where, caressed and rewarded, he might have excited the envy of every
artist; but influenced by the womanish complaints<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> of
Lucrezia, he returned to Florence; and remained in his own country, in
violation of his faith solemnly pledged to that monarch. He afterwards
repented and was anxious to regain his former situation; but his efforts
were ineffectual. He dragged out a miserable existence, amid jealousy
and domestic wretchedness, until, infected with the plague, and
abandoned by his wife and every other individual, he died, in 1530, in
the forty-second year of his age, and had a very mean funeral.</p>

<p>The two who approximated most nearly to the style of Andrea were
Marco Antonio Francia Bigi, as he is named by Baldinucci, called also
Franciabigio, or Francia, as Vasari denominates him, and Pontormo.
Francia was the scholar of Albertinelli for a few months, and then
appears to have formed himself on the best models of the school; and few
are commended so highly by Vasari for a knowledge of anatomy, for
perspective, for the daily habit of drawing the naked figure, and the
exquisite finish of all his performances. One of his Annunciations was
formerly in S. Pier Maggiore; the figures were small and highly
finished, accompanied by good architecture, but not without a certain
degree of dryness. Andrea, his friend, and the associate of his studies,
helped him to a more elevated style. From a companion Francia became his
enthusiastic follower; but, inferior in talents, he never attained the
art of representing such sweetness of disposition, affection so true,
and grace so natural. A semicircular piece of his, representing <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>the
Marriage of the Virgin, may be seen near the works of Andrea, in the
cloister of the Nunziata, where we recognize him as a painter who sought
to attain by labour what the other accomplished by genius. This work was
never completed. Some of the monks having uncovered it before it was
finished, the artist was so offended that he struck the work some blows
with a hammer, in order to deface it; and though they prevented his
accomplishing this, he never after could be prevailed on to complete it,
and no other dared to undertake the task. He was a competitor with
Andrea also in the Scalzo, where he executed two histories that are not
much eclipsed by the pictures in their vicinity. He imitated his friend
likewise at Poggio a Caiano, in a picture of the return of Cicero from
exile: a work of merit, though never finished. It is the great glory of
his pencil, that it was so often employed in contending with Andrea, in
whom it awakened emulation and industry, from the fear of being
surpassed.</p>

<p>Jacopo Carrucci, called Pontormo, from the place of his nativity, was
a man of rare genius, whose early productions obtained the admiration of
Raffaello and Michelangiolo. He got a few lessons from Vinci, and was
afterwards under the care of Albertinelli, and Pier di Cosimo, but he
finally became the pupil of Andrea. He excited the jealousy of this
master, was induced by unhandsome treatment to withdraw from his school,
and afterwards became not only the imitator of Andrea, but <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>his
rival in many undertakings. The Visitation in the cloister of the Servi,
the picture of several saints at S. Michelino, the two pictures of the
History of Joseph, represented in minute figures, in an apartment of the
ducal gallery, shew that he trod without difficulty in the footsteps of
his master, and that congeniality of talent led him into a similar path.
I use the term similar; for he is not a copyist, like those who borrow
heads or whole figures, but invariably retains a peculiar originality. I
saw one of his Holy Families in the possession of the Marquis Cerbone
Pucci, along with others by Baccio, by Rosso, and Andrea: the picture by
Pontormo vied with them all; but yet was sufficiently
characteristic.</p>

<p>He had a certain singularity of disposition, and readily abandoned
one style to try a better; but he was often unsuccessful; as likewise
happened to Nappi, of Milan; to Sacchi, of Rome; and to every other
artist who has made this attempt, at an age too far advanced for a
change of manner. The Carthusian Monastery at Florence has some of his
works, from which connoisseurs have inferred the three styles attributed
to him. The first is correct in design, vigorous in colouring, and
approaches the manner of Andrea. In the second the drawing is good, but
the colouring somewhat languid; and this style became the model for
Bronzino and the artists of the succeeding epoch. The third is a close
imitation of Albert Durer, not only in the composition but in the heads
and draperies;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg
205]</a></span> a manner certainly unworthy of so promising an outset.
It is difficult to find specimens of Pontormo in this style, except some
histories of the Passion, which he servilely copied from the prints of
Albert Durer, for the cloister of that monastery, where he trifled away
several years. We might perhaps notice a fourth manner, if the Deluge
and Last Judgment, on which he spent eleven years at S. Lorenzo, had
still existed: but this his last performance, with the tacit consent of
every artist, was whitewashed. Here he attempted to imitate
Michelangiolo, and like him to afford a model of the anatomical style,
which at this time began to be extolled at Florence above every other:
but he taught us a different lesson, and only succeeded in demonstrating
that an old man ought not to become the votary of fashion.</p>

<p>Andrea pursued the custom of Raffaello and other artists of that age,
in conducting his works with the assistance of painters experienced in
his style, whether they were friends or scholars; a remark not useless
to those who may trace in his pictures the labours of another pencil. It
is known that he gave Pontormo some pieces to finish, and that he
retained one Jacone, and a Domenico Puligo; two individuals who
possessed a natural turn for painting, ready and willing to try every
species of imitation, and more desirous of recreation than of fame. The
façade of the Buondelmonte Palace, at S. Trinità, by the former, was
highly extolled. It was in chiaroscuro; the drawing, in<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
which department he excelled, was very beautiful, and the whole
conducted in the manner of Andrea. He also executed some oil pictures at
Cortona, which are much commended by Vasari. Domenico Puligo was less
skilled in design than in colouring: his tints were sweet, harmonious,
and clear, but he apparently aimed at covering the outline, to relieve
him from the necessity of perfect accuracy. By this mark he is sometimes
recognized in Madonnas and in cabinet pictures, (his usual occupation)
which having been perhaps designed by Andrea, at first sight pass for
the work of that master. Domenico Conti was likewise very intimate with
Andrea, was his scholar and the heir to his drawings; and that great
artist was honoured with a tomb and epitaph designed by Conti, in the
vicinity of his own immortal works in the Nunziata. Excepting this
circumstance, Vasari notices nothing praiseworthy in Conti, and
therefore I shall take no more notice of him. He gives a more favourable
opinion of Pierfrancesco di Jacopo di Sandro, on account of his three
pictures in the church of S. Spirito. He makes honourable mention of two
other artists, who lived long in France, viz. Nannoccio and Andrea
Squazzella, who always retained a similarity to the style of Andrea del
Sarto. It is not our present business to notice those who abandoned it;
for in this work it is my wish to keep sight rather of the different
styles than of the masters.</p>

<p>The fine copies that so often pass for originals,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> in
Florence and other places, are chiefly the work of the above mentioned
artists; nor does it seem credible that Andrea copied so closely his own
inventions, and reduced them with his own hand from the great scale to
small dimensions. I have seen one of his Holy Families, in which S.
Elizabeth appears, in ten or twelve collections; and other pictures in
three or four private houses. I found the S. Lorenzo surrounded by other
saints, at the Pitti Palace, in the Albani gallery; the Visitation, in
the Giustiniani palace; the Birth of our Lady, in the convent of the
Servi, in the possession of Sig. Pirri, at Rome: all these are beautiful
little pictures, all on small panels, all of the old school, and all
believed the work of Andrea. It seems to me not improbable that the best
of these were at least painted in his studio, and retouched by him, a
practice adopted by Tiziano, and even by Raffaello.</p>

<p>Rosso, who contended in the cloisters of the Nunziata, with the best
masters, and who appears in his Assumption to have aimed at a work not
so much superior in beauty as in size to the productions of the other
artists, is among the greatest painters of his school. Endowed with a
creative fancy, he disdained to follow any of his countrymen or
strangers; and indeed one recognizes much originality in his style: his
heads are more spirited, his head dresses and ornaments are more
tasteful, his colouring more lively, his distribution of light and shade
broader, and his pencilling more firm and <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>free, than had been
hitherto seen in Florence. He appears in short to have introduced into
that school a peculiar spirit, that would have been unexceptionable, had
it not been mingled with something of extravagance. Thus, in the
Transfiguration at Città di Castello, instead of the Apostles he
introduced a band of gypsies at the bottom of the picture. His picture
in the Pitti palace, however, is far removed from any such fault. It
exhibits various saints, grouped in so excellent a manner, that the
chiaroscuro of one figure contributes to the relief of another; and it
has such beautiful contrasts of colour and of light, such energy of
drawing and of attitude, that it arrests attention by its originality.
He likewise painted for the State: an unfinished Descent from the Cross
may be seen in the oratory of S. Carlo, in Volterra; and another in the
church of S. Chiara at Città S. Sepolcro; in the cathedral of which
there are many old pictures. Its great merit consists in the principal
group, and that twilight, or almost nocturnal tint, that gives a tone to
the whole piece, sombre, true, and worthy of any Flemish artist. The
works of this painter are very scarce in Italy; for he went to France
into the employment of Francis I. during his best time, and
superintended the ornamental painting and plaster work then going on at
Fontainebleau. Whilst engaged in this work, he unhappily put an end to
his existence by poison; and in the enlargement of the building many of
his works were defaced by Primaticcio, who was a<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> rival, but not a
follower, as is pretended by Cellini.<a name="fnanchor_171"
id="fnanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
Thirteen pictures, dedicated to the fame and actions of Francis I. have
escaped, and are described by Abbé Guget, in his Memoir on the Royal
Academy of France.<a name="fnanchor_172" id="fnanchor_172"></a><a
href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Among these is the
remarkable one of Ignorance Banished by that monarch; a picture that has
been three different times engraved. He was assisted in those works by
several artists, amongst whom were three Florentine painters, Domenico
del Barbieri, Bartolommeo Miniati, and Luca Penni, the brother of that
Gianfrancesco, called Il Fattore in the school of Raffaello.</p>

<p>Ridolfo di Domenico Ghirlandaio lost his father in his infancy; but
was so well initiated in the art, first by his paternal uncle Davide,
and afterwards by Frate, that when Raffaello d'Urbino came to Florence,
he became his admirer and his friend. On his departure from that city he
left with him a Madonna, intended for Siena, that it might be completed
by him; and having soon after gone to Rome, he invited him to assist in
the decorations of the Vatican. Ridolfo declined this, unfortunately for
his own name, which might thus have<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> rivalled that of
Giulio Romano. He undoubtedly possessed a facility, elegance, and
vivacity of manner, to enable him to follow closely the style of his
friend. That he was ambitious of imitating him, may be inferred from the
pictures in his early manner, preserved in the church of S. Jacopo di
Ripoli, and S. Girolamo, that bear some resemblance to the manner of
Perugino, like the early productions of Raffaello. His taste is
displayed to more advantage in two pictures, filled with many moderate
sized figures, which were transferred from the Academy of Design to the
Royal Gallery. They represent two stories of S. Zenobi, and perhaps
approach nearer to the two pictures by Pinturicchio, in the cathedral of
Siena, that were painted under the direction, and partly by the
assistance of Raffaello, than to any other model; with this exception,
that they retain more traces of the old school. We may remark, in the
pictures of Ridolfo, some figures strikingly like those of Raffaello;
and in the whole there appears a composition, an expression, and skill
in improving nature to the standard of ideal beauty, apparently
proceeding from principles conformable to the maxims of that great
master. That he did not afterwards perfect them, is to be attributed to
his not having seen the best productions of his friend, and to his study
of the art having been retarded by his commercial pursuits.</p>

<p>On modernizing his manner, and by this means obtaining reputation, he
aimed at nothing further; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211"
id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>and continued to study painting rather
as an amusement, than as a profession. He assembled round him artists of
every description, and disdained not to impart advice to painters of
ensigns, of furniture, or of scenes; still less to those who executed
pictures for cabinets or churches. Many such who flourished about the
middle of the sixteenth century, are mentioned in history either as his
pupils, or his companions. The following is a brief catalogue of them.
Michele di Ridolfo assumed his name; because, on passing from the
schools of Credi and Sogliani into that of Ridolfo, he was treated not
so much as a companion as a son, till the death of Ghirlandaio. They
painted many pictures conjointly, which always pass under their name;
and of this number is the S. Anne of Città di Castello; an exquisite
picture, both for elegance of design, and a peculiar fulness of
colouring. Michele was particularly eminent in this department, which he
diligently studied in his own works, and employed in his fresco pictures
over several of the gates of the city; and he was selected by Vasari as
the companion of his labours. Mariano da Pescia must have been much
esteemed by Ridolfo; for when this master painted the frescos in the
State Chapel of the Old Palace, a work which gained him high honour, he
wished the smaller pieces to be painted by Mariano. There is a Holy
Family in that place, in a firm but agreeable style: it is the only
remaining production of this artist, who died young. He was of the
Gratiadei <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg
212]</a></span>family; a piece of information for which, with various
others, I am indebted to the politeness of his fellow citizen Sig.
Innocenzio Ansaldi, an able writer, both in poetry and prose, in
whatever relates to the art. Carlo Portelli da Loro in Valdarno,
proceeded from the same school. He painted much in the City, and
sometimes with little harmony: yet the testimony of Vasari, and the
picture of S. Romulus, which remains at the Santa, demonstrate his
ability as an artist. Of Antonio del Ceraiuolo, little remains to
commemorate the painter but the name. Mirabello da Salincorno, who was
employed on the funeral obsequies of Bonarruoti, devoted himself to
cabinet pictures; and an Annunciation, with his name, and the date of
1565, is said to be in the hands of the Baldovinetti family. It would be
tiresome to follow Vasari, who, in several passages of his history,
mentions artists now sunk into oblivion, that might have found a place
here. I close the list with two illustrious names, Perino del Vaga,
already noticed, but afterwards to be more frequently mentioned; and
Toto del Nunziata, reckoned by the English the best of the Italian
artists, who, in that century visited their island; though almost
unknown among us.<a name="fnanchor_173" id="fnanchor_173"></a><a
href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>He was the son of an
obscure artist, but obtained celebrity; and Perino himself had not a
more formidable rival in the school of Ridolfo.</p>

<p>This glorious epoch was not deficient in good landscape painters;
although the art of landscape painting without figures was not yet in
great repute. Vasari highly praises in this line one Antonio di Donnino
Mazzieri, a scholar of Franciabigio, a bold designer, and a man of great
invention in representing horses, and in landscape.</p>

<p>The grotesque came into fashion through the efforts of Morto da
Feltro, and Giovanni da Udine. Both artists were settled at Florence,
and there painted; especially the second, who decorated the palace of
the Medicean family, and the chapel in the church of S. Lorenzo. Andrea,
called di Cosimo, because he was the scholar of Rosselli, learnt this
art from Morto,<a name="fnanchor_174" id="fnanchor_174"></a><a
href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and he obtained the
surname <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg
214]</a></span>of Feltrini, or perhaps Feltrino, from his best known
master. He exercised the invention not only on walls but on furniture,
on banners and festive decorations: abounding in fancy, he was the
leader of a taste originating with him, and much imitated in Florence.
His ornaments were more copious and rich than those of the ancients;
were united in a different manner, and his figures were admirably
adapted to them. Mariotto and Raffaello Mettidoro were his associates;
but no artist was more employed than he in designing foliage for
brocades on cloth, or in ornamental painting. Pier di Cosimo, and
Bachiacca, or Bachicca, were very eminent in the grotesque; of whom,
with others who began the study about the end of the first Epoch, I have
already treated, among the old masters: but none of them modernized more
than the latter, who was usually employed on small subjects,
particularly on the furniture of private houses, and on small pictures,
many of which were sent to England. About the time of his decease he was
employed by the Duke Cosmo. He drew most elegant small historical
designs for tapestry and beds, which were executed by his brother
Antonio, an embroiderer whom Varchi commends; <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>and by Gio. Rossi, and
Niccolo Fiamminghi, who introduced the art of tapestry weaving into
Florence.<a name="fnanchor_175" id="fnanchor_175"></a><a
href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> His best work was a
cabinet, which he ornamented divinely, says Vasari, with flowers and
birds in oil colours.</p>

<p>Perspective was not cultivated in Italy during the 15th century,
except so far as subservient to historical painting, and in this
department the Venetian and Lombard masters were no less eminent than
those of Florence or of Rome. After this period, artists began to
represent arches, colonnades, porticos, and every other kind of
architecture, in pictures appropriated to such subjects, to the great
ornament of the theatres, and of religious and convivial festivities.
One of the first who devoted himself to this study was Bastiano di
Sangallo, the nephew of Giuliano, and of Antonio, and the brother of
another Antonio, all of whom were eminent in architecture. He got the
surname of Aristotile, from his disquisitions on anatomy, or on
perspective, accompanied by a certain philosophic authority and
ingenuity. He acquired the principles of his art from Pietro Perugino,
but he soon abandoned his school, to adopt a more modern style. He
exercised himself for several years in painting figures; he copied some
subjects after his friends Michelangiolo and Raffaello; and aided by the
advice <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg
216]</a></span>of Andrea and Ridolfo, he produced not a few Madonnas and
other pictures of his own composition: but not possessing invention in
an eminent degree he latterly dedicated his attention wholly to
perspective, in which he was initiated by Bramante; and exercised it
during this epoch, when Florence abounded with grand funeral obsequies,
and public festivities. Of these, the most memorable were those
instituted on the election of Leo X. in 1513, and on his visit to
Florence in 1515. He had in his train Michelangiolo, Raffaello, and
other professors of the art, to deliberate concerning the façade of the
church of S. Lorenzo, and other works which he meditated. His court
added pomp to every spectacle; and Florence became, as it were, a new
city. Arches were erected in the streets by Granacci and Rosso; temples
or new façades were designed by Antonio da San Gallo, and Jacopo
Sansovino; chiaroscuros were prepared by Andrea del Sarto; grotesques by
Feltrino; basso-relievos, statues, and colossal figures, by Sansovino
above mentioned, by Rustici, and Bandinelli; Ghirlandaio, Pontormo,
Franciabigio, and Ubertini, adorned with exquisite taste the residence
of the pontiff. I say nothing of the meaner artists, although in another
age even these would not have been classed with the vulgar herd, but
have obtained distinction: I shall content myself with observing that
this emulation of genius, this display of the fine arts, in short this
auspicious period, sufficed to confer on Florence the lasting
appellation of another <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217"
id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>Athens; on Leo the name of another
Pericles or Augustus.</p>

<p>Spectacles of this sort became afterwards more common to the
citizens; for the Medici, on commencing their domination over a people
whom they feared, affected popularity, like the Roman Cæsars, by
promoting public hilarity. Hence, not only on extraordinary occasions,
such as the elevation of Clement VII. to the papal chair, of Alexander,
and of Cosmo to the chief magistracy of their country, on the marriage
of the latter, on that of Giuliano and of Lorenzo de' Medici, and on the
arrival of Charles V.; not only on such occasions, but frequently at
other times, they instituted tournaments, masquerades, and
representations, of which the decorations were magnificent, such as
cars, robes, and scenery. In this improved state of every thing
conducive to exquisite embellishment, industry became excited, and the
number of painters and ornamental artists increased. Aristotile, to
return to him, was always much employed; his perspectives were in great
request in public places; his scenes in the theatre: the populace,
unaccustomed to those ocular deceptions, were astonished; and it seemed
to them as if they could ascend the steps, enter the edifices, and
approach the balconies and windows in the pictures. The long life of
Aristotile, coeval with the best epoch of painting, permitted him to
serve the ruling family and his country, until his old age, when
Salviati and Bronzino began to be preferred to him. He died in 1551.</p>

<p>While the city of Florence acquired so much <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>glory by the genius of
her artists, the other parts of the state afforded materials for future
history, chiefly through the assistance of the Roman school. This
happened more especially after 1527, when the sack of Rome dispersed the
school of Raffaello and its young branches. Giulio Romano trained
Benedetto Pagni at Pescia, who ought to be noticed among the assistants
of his master at Mantua. If we credit some late writers, his native
place possesses many of his works: but I acquiesce in the opinion of
Sig. Ansaldi, in refusing to admit any of them as genuine, except the
façade of the habitation of the Pagni family, now injured by time, and
the picture of the Marriage of Cana in the Collegiate church, which is
not his best production. Pistoia is indebted to Gio. Francesco Penni, or
perhaps to Fattore, for a respectable scholar: this was Lionardo, an
artist much employed in Naples and in Rome, where he was named Il
Pistoia. I find him surnamed Malatesta by some, Guelfo by others; but I
suspect that his true family name is to be collected from an inscription
on an Annunciation in the little chapel of the canons of Lucca, which
runs thus, <i>Leonardus Gratia Pistoriensis</i>. I am indebted to Sig.
T. F. Bernardi above mentioned for this fact: and the picture is worthy
of a descendant of Raffaello. I do not know that there is a single trace
of Lionardo remaining in his native place: at the village of Guidi, in
the diocese of Pistoia, one of his pictures is to be seen in the church
of S. Peter, where the titular, and three other saints, stand around
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg
219]</a></span> throne of the Virgin.<a name="fnanchor_176"
id="fnanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
Sebastiano Vini came from Verona, in I know not what year of the 16th
century, and was enrolled among the citizens of Pistoia. His reputation
and his pictures did honour to the country that adopted him. He left
many works both in oil and fresco; but his most extraordinary production
was in the suppressed church of S. Desiderio. The façade over the great
altar was storied with the crucifixion of the ten thousand martyrs, a
work abounding in figures and invention. I have noticed the younger
Zacchia of Lucca, who belongs to this epoch, in the preceding one, that
I might not separate the father and the son. I am unable to find any
other artists sufficiently worthy of record in this district of
Tuscany.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of it we may turn our eyes to Cortona, and
notice two good artists. The one was Francesco Signorelli, the nephew of
Luca, who, though unnoticed by Vasari, shows himself<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> a
painter worthy of praise, by a circular picture of the patron saints of
the city, which was executed for the council hall, in 1320; after which
period he lived at least forty years. The other was Tommaso Paparello,
or Papacello, both which names are given him by Vasari, when writing of
his two masters, Caporali and Giulio Romano. He assisted them both, but
I can discover no trace of any work wholly his own.</p>

<p>Borgo, afterwards named Città San Sepolcro, could then boast its
Raffaello, commonly called Raffaellino dal Colle, born at a small place
a few miles from Borgo. He is reckoned among the disciples of Raffaello;
but rather belongs to the school of Giulio, whose pupil, dependant, or
assistant in his labours at Rome, and in the <i>Te</i> at Mantua, he is
considered by Vasari. It is singular that he did not write a separate
life of this artist; but assigns him scanty praise in a few scattered
anecdotes. His merit is but little known to the public, as he painted
for the most part in his native place, or the neighbouring cities; and I
am able to add to the catalogue of his pictures from having seen them.
He has two pictures at Città San Sepolcro, his only works specified by
Vasari. One represents the resurrection of our Saviour, who, full of
majesty, regards the soldiers around the sepulchre with an air of
displeasure, which fills them with terror. This very spirited picture is
in the Church of S. Rocco, and is repeated in the cathedral. The other,
which is in the Osservanti of S. Francis, represents<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> the
Assumption of the Virgin; a piece agreeable both in colouring and
design, but its value is diminished by a figure I am unable to explain,
drawn at one side of it by another hand. The same subject is treated in
the church of the Conventual friars, at Città di Castello, where great
beauty is joined to the highest possible finish, but it loses something
of its effect by standing opposite to a fine picture by Vasari, which
throws it strongly into the shade. An entombing of Christ by
Raffaellino, is in the Servi; a very beautiful picture, but the
colouring is less firm; and there is another of his works at S. Angelo
with S. Michael, and S. Sebastian, who humbly presents an arrow, a type
of his martyrdom, to the infant Jesus and the Virgin. In this the
composition is simple but graceful in every part. A picture of our Lady,
with S. Sebastian, S. Rocco, and a canonized bishop, painted in a
similar style, is to be seen in the church of S. Francis of Cagli; in it
the figures and the landscape much resemble the manner of Raffaello. His
Apostles in the sacristy of the cathedral of Urbino are noble figures,
draped in a grand style, in small oblong pictures, firmly coloured. The
Olivet monks of Gubbio have in one of their chapels a Nativity by
Raffaellino, and two pieces from the history of S. Benedict, painted in
fresco, in which he was, I believe, assisted by his scholars. The former
is certainly superior to the two last, although he has introduced in
them real portraits, finely conceived architecture, and added a figure
of Virtue in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222"
id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> upper part, that seems a sister of the
Sybils of Raffaello. He also painted, in the castle of Perugia, and in
the <i>Imperiale</i> of Pesaro, a villa of the duke of Urbino, to whom
he afforded more satisfaction than the two Dossi. After having assisted
Raffaello and Giulio, he disdained not to paint after the designs of
less eminent artists. On the arrival of Charles V. at Florence, in 1536,
he assisted Vasari, who was one of the decorators; and he painted
cartoons after the designs of Bronzino, for the tapestry of Cosmo I.;
after which period I do not find him mentioned. Another instance of his
diffidence is the following: on the arrival of Rosso at San Sepolcro,
Raffaellino, out of respect to that artist, gave up to him an order for
a picture which he was to have executed; a rare instance among painters,
who are in the habit of using kindly those artists only, who come merely
to see a city, and immediately leave it. He kept a school at San
Sepolcro, whence proceeded Gherardi, Vecchi, and other artists, some of
whom, perhaps, surpassed him in genius; but they did not equal him in
grace, nor in high finish.</p>

<p>About this time many artists flourished in Arezzo, but of these two
only are praised by Vasari, who is not sparing in his commendations of
the Florentines, as I have remarked, but deals them scantily to his own
townsmen. Giovanni Antonio, the son of Matteo Lappoli, was the scholar
of Pontormo, and the friend of Perino and of Rosso, with whom he lived
in Tuscany, and whose style he emulated <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>in Rome. He was more
employed in painting for private houses than for churches. Guglielmo,
surnamed Da Marcilla, by Vasari, a foreigner by birth, became a citizen
of Arezzo from inclination and long residence; he was dear to the
citizens, who afforded him the means of enjoying life, and grateful to
the city, where he left most beautiful monuments of his genius. He had
been a Dominican in his own country; he became a secular priest on
arriving in Italy, and at Arezzo he was called the Prior. He was an
excellent painter on glass, and on this account, was brought to Rome by
one Claude, a Frenchman, to execute windows for Julius II.; but he also
employed himself in fresco. He studied design in Italy, and so improved
in that art, that his works at Rome seem designs of the fourteenth
century, while the Aretine ones appear the work of a modern. He painted
some ceilings and arches in the cathedral, with scriptural subjects in
fresco. In design he followed Michelangiolo, as nearly as he could; but
his colouring was not firm. His paintings on glass are quite in a
different style; there, to very good drawing, and uncommon expression,
he joined tints that partake of the emerald, the ruby, and of oriental
sapphire, and which, when illuminated by the sun, exhibit all the
brilliance of the rainbow. In Arezzo, there are so many windows of this
glass at the cathedral, at S. Francis, and at many other churches, that
they might excite the envy of much larger cities. They are so finely
wrought <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg
224]</a></span>with subjects from the New Testament, and other
scriptural histories, that they seem to have reached the perfection of
the art. The Vocation of S. Matthew, in a window of the cathedral, is
highly praised by Vasari; it exhibits "perspectives of temples and
flights of steps, figures so finely composed, landscapes so well
executed, that one can hardly imagine they were glass, but something
sent down from Heaven for the delight of mankind."</p>

<p>This place and period remind me, that before I pass on to another
epoch, I ought to say a few words concerning the invention of painting
on glass, which was anciently likewise styled Mosaic, because it was
composed of pieces of different coloured glass, connected by lead, which
represented the shadows. We may observe glass windows that emulate well
composed pictures on canvass or on panel; and this art is treated of by
Vasari in the thirty-second chapter of the introduction to his work.
From the preface to the treatise <i>De omni scientiâ artis pingendi</i>,
by Theophilus the Monk, I find that France was celebrated for this art
beyond any other country;<a name="fnanchor_177" id="fnanchor_177"></a><a
href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and there the art seems
to have been invariably cultivated, and brought by degrees to
perfection. From the earliest ages of the revival of painting, the
Italians wrought windows with different coloured glasses, as is remarked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg
225]</a></span>by P. Angeli in his description of the churches of
Assisi, where the most ancient specimens are to be seen. In the church
likewise of the Franciscan friars at Venice, we find that one <i>Frater
Theotonius</i>, a German, worked in tapestry and glass windows, and was
imitated by one Marco, a painter, who lived in the year 1335.<a
name="fnanchor_178" id="fnanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178"
class="fnanchor">[178]</a> It may also be observed, that such windows
over the altars supplied the place of sacred paintings in churches;
Christian congregations, in lifting up their eyes, there sought the
resemblance of what "they hoped some time to behold in the celestial
paradise: che ancor lassù nel ciel vedere spera," and they often
addressed their supplications to those images. In the fifteenth century
Lorenzo Ghiberti, a man eminent in various arts, still further improved
this, and ornamented the oval windows of the façade of the church of S.
Francis, and of the cathedral of Florence with coloured glass. In a
similar manner he finished all the oval apertures in the cupola of the
cathedral, except that of the Assumption, executed by Donatello. The
glass was manufactured at Florence, for which purpose one Domenico Livi,
a native of Gambassi, in the principality of Volterra, who had learnt
and practised the art at Lubec, was<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> invited to that place,
as is proved by Baldinucci in his correction of Vasari.<a
name="fnanchor_179" id="fnanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179"
class="fnanchor">[179]</a> From this school apparently came Goro, and
Bernardo di Francesco, with that train of Ingesuati, whose workmanship,
exhibited at S. Lorenzo and elsewhere, has been much commended by the
Florentine historians. (See Moreni, part vi. p. 41.) This art afterwards
flourished at Arezzo, where it was introduced by Parri Spinelli, a
scholar of Ghiberti. About the same time flourished in Perugia P. D.
Francesco, a monk of Cassino, not merely a painter in glass, but a
master in that city; and some conjecture that Vannucci profited by his
school, though a comparison of dates does not much favour such a
supposition. This art also flourished in Venice, about 1473, where one
window was executed after the design of Bartolommeo Vivarini, in the
church of S. John and S. Paul, and another was erected at Murano; but
the art of painting glass could not be unknown at this last place, where
it originated.</p>

<p>It is true, that in process of time the Florentine and Venetian glass
appeared to be not sufficiently transparent for such purposes; and that
a preference was given to that of France and of England, the clearness
and transparency of which was better adapted for receiving the colours,
without too much obscuring the light. It had this other advantage, that
the colours were burnt in the glass, in the manner described by Vasari,
instead of being laid on with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227"
id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>gums or other vehicles; hence they had
greater brilliancy, and were more capable of resisting the injuries of
time. This was a Flemish, or rather a French invention, and the Italians
unquestionably received it from France. Bramante invited from that
country the two artists above mentioned, who, besides the windows of the
Vatican palace, that were wrought with colours burnt into the glass, and
destroyed in the sack of Rome, in the time of Clement VII. ornamented
two in the church of S. Maria del Popolo, with those scriptural
histories that yet remain perfectly brilliant in colour, after the lapse
of three centuries. Soon after this Claude died at Rome. William
survived him many years, and from that time continued to reside in
Arezzo. He there was engaged in the service of the capital, where one of
his painted glass windows is preserved in the Capponi chapel, at the
church of S. Felicità; and he taught the art to Pastorino of Siena, who
exercised it very skilfully in the state saloon of the Vatican, after
the designs of Vaga, and in the cathedral of Siena. This artist is
reckoned the best scholar of his master. Maso Porro, Michelagnolo
Urbani, both natives of Cortona, and Batista Borro of Arezzo, were
trained in the same school, and were afterwards employed in Tuscany and
elsewhere. In ornamenting the old palace, Vasari availed himself of the
assistance of two Flemish artists, Walter and George, who wrought after
his designs. Celebrated equal to any artist is Valerio Profondavalle of
Louvain, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg
228]</a></span>who settled at Milan after the middle of the sixteenth
century, a man of fertile invention, and a pleasing colourist in fresco
painting, but chiefly eminent in painting on glass, as we are informed
by Lomazzo. Orlandi celebrates Gerardo Ornerio Frisio, and his windows
executed about 1575, in the church of S. Peter at Bologna. This art
afterwards declined, when custom, the arbiter of arts, by excluding it
from palaces and churches, caused it gradually to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Another method of painting on glass, or rather on crystal, was much
in fashion in the last century, and was employed for ornamenting
mirrors, caskets, and other furniture of the chambers of the great.
Maratta and his <ins title="'cotemporaries' in the
original.">contemporaries</ins> on crystal for such works in the same
style that they employed in painting on canvass; and above all Giordano,
who taught it to several pupils. Among these, the best was Carlo
Garofalo, who was invited to the court of Charles II. of Spain, to
practise this species of painting,<a name="fnanchor_180"
id="fnanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
the era of which does not embrace a great number of years.</p>

Although Vasari, Borghini, and Baldinucci, have also treated of other
schools, they have chiefly illustrated that of Florence, with which they
were best acquainted. To them succeeded the respectable authors of the
<i>Florentine Museum</i>, and of the <i>Series of the most celebrated
Painters</i>, containing choice anecdotes of those masters, which are
now republished, and accompanied by a print from the work of each
painter, in the <i>Etruria Pittrice</i> of the learned Sig. Ab. Lastri.
Other anecdotes are to be found in the work of P. Richa <i>On the
Churches of Florence</i>, and in Sig. Cambiagi's <i>Guide</i> to that
City. Pisa too, has its <i>Guide</i> by the Cav. Titi; to which has
succeeded the much larger work of Sig. da Morrona, above noticed. Siena
has one by Sig. Pecci, Volterra another by Ab. Giachi, and Pescia and
Valdinievole by the Ab. Ansaldi. Sig. Francesco Bernardi, an excellent
connoisseur in the fine arts, prepared a guide to Lucca after Marchiò;

None however of these great men presumed to despise Michelangiolo so
much, as to compare the picture of Christ, in the Minerva, to an
executioner; like the author of the <i>Arte di Vedere</i>. Mengs, whom
he rather flatters than follows, would have disdained to use this and
similar expressions; but it is the office of adulators not merely to
approve the opinion of the object flattered, but greatly to exaggerate
it. Juvenal, with his peculiar penetration into the vices of mankind,
thus describes one of the race. (See Satire iii. v. 100.)</p>

Raffaello came to Florence towards the end of 1504. (<i>Lett. Pitt.</i>
tom. i. p. 2.) In this year Michelangiolo was called to Rome, and left
his cartoon imperfect. Having afterwards fled from Rome, through dread
of Julius II., he completed it in three months, in the year 1506.
Compare the Brief of Julius, in which he recals Michelangiolo (<i>Lett.
Pitt.</i> tom. iii. p. 320), with the relation of Vasari (tom. vi. Ed.
Fiorent. p. 191). During the time that Michelangiolo laboured at this
work, "he was unwilling to shew it to any person (p. 182); and when it
was finished it was carried to the hall of the Pope," and was there
studied (p. 184). Raffaello had then returned to Florence, and this work
might open the way to his new style, which, as a learned Englishman
expresses it, is intermediate between that of Michelangiolo and of
Perugino.</p>

The ignorant believe that Michelangiolo "nailed a man to a cross and
left him there to expire, in order to paint from the life a figure of
our Saviour on the cross." See Dati, in his notes of the Life of
Parrhasius, who is said to have committed a similar homicide. This story
of the latter is probably a fable, and undoubtedly it is so of
Michelangiolo. The crucifixions of this artist are often repeated,
sometimes with a single figure, sometimes with our Lady and S. John; at
other times with two Angels, who collect the blood. Bottari mentions
several of these pictures in different galleries. To these we may add
the picture of the Caprara palace, and those in the possession of
Monsignor Bonfigliuoli and of Sigg. Biancani in Bologna. Sig. Co.
Chiappini of Piacenza has a very good one, and there is another in the
church of the college of Ravenna.</p>

Bottari, in his <i>Notes</i> to the Letter of Preziado, doubts whether
this supposed scholar of Michelangiolo be Galeazzo Alessi, remarking at
the same time that this last was rather an architect than a painter. I
am inclined to think that the Matteo in question may have been the
foregoing Matteo da <i>Lecce</i>, or da Leccio, and that owing to one of
those errors, which Clerche in his "Arte Critica," calls <i>ex
auditu</i>, his name in Spain became D'Alessi, or D'Alessio, the letters
<i>c</i> and <i>s</i> in many countries being made use of reciprocally.
Besides, this <i>Leccese</i>, of whom we write in the fourth volume,
flourished in the time of Vargas, went to Spain, affected the style of
Michelangiolo, and never settled himself in any place from his desire of
seeing the world. Memoirs of him appear to have been collected in Spain,
by Pacheco, who lived in 1635 (Conca, iii. 252), who in his account, at
this distance of time, must have been guided by vulgar report; a bad
authority for names, particularly those of foreigners, as was noticed in
the Preface. That he should further be called Roman instead of Italian,
in a foreign country, and that he should there adopt the name of Perez,
not having assumed any surname in Rome, can scarcely appear strange to
the reader, and the more so as he is described as an adventurer&mdash;a
species of persons who subsist upon tricks and frauds.</p>

That Raffaello was at this time well versed in perspective it is
unreasonable to doubt, as Bottari has done: he proceeded from the school

specimen at Siena, where he remained some time before he came to
Florence.</p>

About the time when Michele taught, there resided in Spain one Tommaso
Fiorentino; one of whose portraits is mentioned by the Sig. Ab. Conca,
(tom. i. p. 90,) belonging to the Royal Palace at Madrid. In the Ducal
Palace of Alva, there are also galleries of grotesques, where we read
the name of Tommaso Fiorentino, the author, to which is added (tom. ii.
p. 362) "The name of this professor of the art is quite new to me; in
his grotesques we meet with the exact style of the sons of Bergamasco,
&amp;c." I hardly know how the name can appear new to the Ab. Conca,
when he had already mentioned it elsewhere; nor how the composition of
an artist, who painted in 1521, could resemble that of others who were
still young in the year 1570, in which their father died.</p>

Vasari, in his Life of Morto, says, that he came to Florence in order to
improve his skill in figures, in which he was deficient, by studying the
models of Vinci and of Michelangiolo. In despair, however, he returned
to his grotesques. Now I shall elsewhere produce an unedited document
shewing his ability in figure painting, which I should not have occasion
to do if the beautiful portrait of Morto, in the Royal Gallery at
Florence, was, as is conjectured, by his hand. But I am inclined to
think that it is the likeness of an unknown person, who, as I have seen
in other portraits, caused himself to be drawn with a finger pointing to
a death's head, in order to remind him of his mortality, but in this
picture the head has been capriciously interpreted as a symbol of the
name of Morto, and the painting given as the portrait and work of
Feltrese; of whom Vasari gives a very different one.</p>

A similar composition is to be seen in an altar-piece in the cathedral
of Volterra. It is inscribed, <i>Opus Leonardi Pistoriens. an. 1516</i>.
This, however, ought not to be passed over on account of an historical
doubt started by the Cavalier Tolomei, whether there flourished, at the
same period, two Lionardi da Pistoja; thus insinuating they were of
different families. And this would appear to be the case. The painter of
the piece in Volterra was not Grazia, at Naples, probably, surnamed
Guelfo; since his master Penni, if we are to believe Vasari, was in that
year, 1516, still the scholar and assistant of Raffaello; nor does it
seem probable that he educated a pupil of so much merit. The Leonardo,
therefore, who painted in Volterra, must have been some other of more
proficiency.</p>

<h4 class="p4">FLORENTINE SCHOOL.</h4>

<h4>EPOCH III.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><i>The Imitators of Michelangiolo
Bonarruoti.</i></div>

<p class="p2">After the time of the five great masters above mentioned,
the Florentines were so rich in fine specimens of art that they had no
occasion to apply to foreign schools for improvement. They had only to
select the best specimens from the works of native artists; as, for
instance, grandeur from Michelangiolo, grace from Andrea, and spirit
from Rossi; they could learn colouring and casting of draperies from
Porta, and chiaroscuro from Vinci. They appear, however, to have
assiduously applied to design, but to have paid little attention to the
other branches of painting. Even in that branch they imagined that every
thing was to be found in Bonarruoti; and imitated him alone. Their
choice was influenced by the celebrity,<a name="fnanchor_181"
id="fnanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
the success, and very long life of this artist, who, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg
230]</a></span>having survived all his eminent fellow citizens,
naturally recommended to employment the followers of his maxims, and the
adherents of his manner; hence it has been observed by some, that
Raffaello lived too short a time for the progress of the fine arts,
Michelangiolo too long. But artists ought to keep in mind the opinion,
or rather prophecy of Bonarruoti&mdash;that his style would be
productive of inept artists, which has invariably been the character of
those who have imitated him without judgment.</p>

<p>Their study and constant practice has been to design from his
statues: for the cartoon on which so many eminent men formed their
style, had already perished; and his paintings were not to be seen in
Florence but in Rome. They transferred into their compositions that
statue-like rigidity, that strength of limb, and those markings of the
origin and insertion of muscles, that severity of countenance, and those
positions of the hands and figures, which characterized his sublimely
awful style; but without comprehending the principles of this
extraordinary man, without thoroughly understanding the play of the
softer parts of the human figure, either by inserting them in wrong
situations, or by representing, in the same manner, those in action and
at rest; those of a slender stripling, and of the full-grown man.
Contented with what they imagined grandeur of style, they neglected all
the rest. In some of their pictures we may observe a multitude of
figures arranged one above the other, with a total disregard of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg
231]</a></span>relative situations; features that express no passion,
and half naked figures that do nothing, except pompously exhibit, like
the Entellus of Virgil, <i>magna ossa lacertosque</i>. Instead of the
beautiful azure and green formerly employed, they substituted a languid
yellowish hue; the full body of colour gave place to superficial tints;
and, above all, the bold relief, so much studied till the time of
Andrea, went wholly into disuse.</p>

<p>In several passages Baldinucci confesses this decline, which,
however, scarcely extended to two or three generations, and seems to
have commenced about 1540. During this unfortunate era the Florentines
did not degenerate as much as some other schools. The churches are full
of pictures of this era, which, if they are not to be admired like those
of the preceding, are, at least, respectable. Whoever sees the church of
S. Croce, S. Maria Novella, and other places, where the best artists of
this era painted, will undoubtedly find more to praise than to condemn.
Few of them were eminent as colourists, but many in design; few were
entirely free from the mannerism above noticed; many, however, by
progressive improvement, at length attained gracefulness. We shall
proceed to consider them, chiefly following the steps of Vincenzio
Borghini, their contemporary; the author of <i>Il Reposo</i>, a dialogue
worthy of perusal, both for the matter and the style. We shall commence
with Vasari, who not only belongs to this epoch,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> but has ever been
charged with being one of the chief authors of the decline of the art.<a
name="fnanchor_182" id="fnanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182"
class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Giorgio Vasari, of Arezzo, was descended from a family attached to
the fine arts; being the great grandson of Lazzaro, who was the intimate
friend of Pietro della Francesca, and the imitator of his paintings; the
nephew of another Giorgio, who, in modelling vases in plaster, revived
the forms of the antique, in their basso-relievos, and their brilliant
colours; specimens of whose art exist in the royal gallery at Florence.
Michelangiolo, Andrea, and some other masters, instructed him in design;
Guglielmo da Marcilla, called the Prior, and Rosso, initiated him in
painting: but he chiefly studied at Rome, whither he was brought by
Ippolito, Cardinal de' Medici, the person to whom he owed his success;
for by his means Giorgio was introduced to this family that loaded him
with riches and with honour. After having designed all the works of his
first master, and of Raffaello, at Rome, and likewise much after other
schools and antique marbles, he formed a style in which we may recognise
traces of his studies; but his predilection for Bonarruoti is apparent.
After acquiring skill in painting figures, he became one of the most
excellent architects of the age; and united in himself the various
branches which were known to Perino, Giulio, and their scholars, who
followed the example of Raffaello. He could unaided direct the
construction of a grand <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233"
id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>fabric, adorn it with figures, with
grotesques, with landscapes, with stuccos, with gilding, and whatever
else was required to ornament it in a princely style. By this means he
began to be known in Italy; and was employed as a painter in several
places, and even in Rome. He was much employed in the hermitage of the
Camaldules, and in several monasteries of the Olivets. In their
monastery at Rimino he executed a picture of the Magi, and various
frescos for the church; in that at Bologna three pieces from sacred
history, with some ornaments in the refectory; but still more in that at
Naples, where he not only reduced the refectory to the rules of true
architecture, but splendidly adorned it with stuccos and pictures of
every description. Assisted by many young men he spent a year in this
work; and, as he himself says, was the first who gave an idea of the
modern style to that city. Some of his pictures are to be seen in the
Classe di Ravenna, in the church of S. Peter at Perugia, at Bosco, near
Alessandria, in Venice, at Pisa, in Florence, and at Rome, where the
largest part of them are in various places of the Vatican, and in the
hall of the Chancery. These pictures are historical frescos of the life
of Paul III. undertaken at the desire of Cardinal Farnese; with whom
originated the idea of writing the lives of the painters, afterwards
published at Florence. Brought into notice by these works, honoured by
the esteem and friendship of Bonarruoti, and recommended by his
multifarious abilities, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234"
id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>he was invited to the court of Cosmo I.
He went there with his family in 1553; at which time the artists above
alluded to were either dead or very old, and, therefore, he had little
to fear from competitors. He superintended the magnificent works
executed by that prince; among which it would be wrong not to
distinguish the edifice for the public offices, which is esteemed among
the finest in Italy; and the old palace, with its several sub-divisions,
which were all painted and decorated by Vasari and his pupils for the
use of government. In one part of it, each chamber bears the name of
some distinguished member of the family, and represents his exploits.
This is one of his best works; and here the chamber of Clement VII. is
chiefly conspicuous, on the ceiling of which he represented the Pontiff
in the act of crowning Charles V., and all around disposed the emblems
of his virtues, his victories, and his most remarkable exploits. In this
work the magnificence of the prince is rivalled by the judgment and
taste of the artist. The reader may find notices of his other works,
which are either in churches or in private houses, and of his temporary
decorations for funerals or festivals, by consulting his life written by
himself down to 1567, and the continuation of it to 1574, the year of
Giorgio's decease.</p>

<p>It remains for us to discuss the merits of this artist, who has been
praised by some and condemned by other authors that have treated of the
fine arts, especially in Italy. I shall consider him<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
first as a painter, and next as a writer. Had all his works perished but
some of those in the old palace, the Conception, in S. Apostolo at
Florence, which Borghini commends as his finest production, the
Decollation of S. John, in the church of the Baptist at Rome, which is
adorned by exquisite perspective, the Feast of Ahasuerus, in the
possession of the Benedictines at Arezzo, some of his portraits, which
Bottari scruples not to compare with those of Giorgione, and some of his
other pictures that demonstrate his ability, his reputation would have
been much greater than it is. But he aimed at too much; and for the most
part preferred expedition to accuracy. Hence, though a good designer,
his figures are not always correct; and his painting often appears
languid, from his meagre and superficial colouring.<a
name="fnanchor_183" id="fnanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183"
class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The habit of careless execution is usually
the companion of some maxim that may serve to excuse it to others, as
well as to our own self-love: Vasari has recommended in his writings the
acquirement of compendious methods,<a name="fnanchor_184"
id="fnanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
and "the expedition of practice;" <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>in other words, to make
use of former exercises and studies in painting. This method is highly
advantageous to the artist, because it increases his profits; but is
prejudicial to the art, which thus degenerates into mannerism, or, in
other words, departs from nature: Vasari fell into this error in many of
his works, especially in his hasty productions, or where he borrowed the
hand of others; apologies which he frequently offers to the readers of
his "Lives." He was principally induced, I believe, to offer such
apologies for his practice, from the strictures on his paintings
contained in the hall of the Chancery, which were finished in a hundred
days, according to their author, in order to please the cardinal: but he
ought then rather to have excused himself to Farnese, and to have
requested him to employ some other artist, than to make his apology to
posterity, and to intreat us to excuse his faults. He ought to have
listened to the admonitions of his friends; among whom Caro did not fail
to remind him of the injury his reputation might sustain by such hasty
productions.<a name="fnanchor_185" id="fnanchor_185"></a><a
href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> As he long superintended
the decorations of the capital, ordered by Cosmo I. and Prince D.
Francesco, and was assisted in them by many young men, Baldinucci
affirms that he chiefly contributed to that dry manner which prevailed
in Florence.<a name="fnanchor_186" id="fnanchor_186"></a><a
href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>This opinion is probably not erroneous; for the example of a painter
employed by the court was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237"
id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>sufficient to seduce the rising
generation from pristine diligence, to a more careless manner. After
all, the Florentines who assisted him were chiefly the scholars of
Bronzino, and, except two or three, they did not adopt the style of
Vasari: some others also may have done so for a little time. Francesco
Morandini, called Poppi, from his native place, was his disciple and
imitator; and in his picture of the Conception, at S. Michelino, in the
superior one of the Visitation, at S. Nicholas, and in his many other
works, he appears a follower of Giorgio; except that he was more minute,
and attended more to gay and cheerful composition. Giovanni Stradano
Fiammingo, for ten years a dependant of Vasari, adopted his colouring,
but imitated the design of Salviati; with whom and also with Daniele di
Volterra he had lived in Rome. There is a Christ on the Cross, by him,
at the Serviti, which is preferred to any other he painted at Florence,
where he executed many designs for tapestry, and many prints. He had a
fertile invention; he is praised by Vasari as highly as any other artist
then in the service of the court, and is considered by Borghini among
the eminent masters. Vasari after him retained Jacopo Zucchi, whose
works exhibit none of the carelessness of Giorgio. He sometimes imitated
him; but his style is better and more refined. He lived long at Rome,
under the protection of Ferdinando, Cardinal de' Medici, in whose house,
and more especially in the Rucellai palace, he painted in fresco with
incredible <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg
238]</a></span>diligence. His picture of the Birth of the Baptist, in S.
Giovanni Decollato, is esteemed the best in that church; and in this
piece he appears more a follower of Andrea, than of any other master. He
usually introduced real portraits of distinguished characters and men of
letters in his compositions, and he shewed a peculiar grace in the
figures of children and of young people. Baglioni praises both this
artist and his brother Francesco, who was a good artist in mosaic, and
an excellent painter of fruit and flowers.</p>

<p>In considering Giorgio as a writer, I shall not consume much time;
having so frequently to notice him in the course of my work. He wrote
precepts of art and lives of the painters, as is well known; and he
added to them some dissertations on his own occupations,<a
name="fnanchor_187" id="fnanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187"
class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and his pictures.<a name="fnanchor_188"
id="fnanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
He entered on this work at the instigation of Cardinal Farnese, as well
as of Monsig. Giovio; and he was encouraged in it by Caro, Molza,
Tolomei, and other literary men belonging to that court. His first
intention was to collect anecdotes of artists, to be extended by Giovio.
They wished him to commence <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239"
id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>with Cimabue; with which, perhaps, he
ought not to have complied; but this circumstance diminishes the fault
of Vasari in passing over the older masters in silence, and raises the
glory of Cimabue far above all his contemporaries. When it was
discovered that Vasari could write well,<a name="fnanchor_189"
id="fnanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
and was capable of extending the anecdotes in even more appropriate
language than Giovio himself, the whole task devolved on him; but in
order to render the work more worthy of the public, he had the
assistance afforded him of men of letters. In 1547, on finishing the
book, he went to Rimino; and whilst he was employed in painting for the
fraternity of Olivets, Father D. Gio. Matteo Faetani, abbot of the
monastery, corrected his work and caused it to be wholly transcribed;
about the end of that year it was sent to Caro for perusal. He signified
his approbation of it, "as written in a fine style, and with great
care;"<a name="fnanchor_190" id="fnanchor_190"></a><a
href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> except that in some
passages a less artificial style was desirable. After being corrected in
this respect, it was printed in two volumes by Torrentino, at Florence,
in the year 1550; in this edition he received considerable aid from
Father D. Miniato Pitti, then an Olivetine friar.<a name="fnanchor_191"
id="fnanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
Vasari complained that "many things were there <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>inserted he knew not
how, and were altered without his knowledge or consent;"<a
name="fnanchor_192" id="fnanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192"
class="fnanchor">[192]</a> but I cannot agree with Bottari,<a
name="fnanchor_193" id="fnanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193"
class="fnanchor">[193]</a> that these alterations were made by Pitti or
any other monk. If Vasari could not discover their author, we are much
less likely to find him out; and there is some ground for believing that
Vasari had offended many persons by certain invidious anecdotes, and
thus endeavoured to excuse himself as well as he could. Who can believe
that the many things cancelled in the second edition, which seems almost
a new work, were all liberties taken by other persons, "he did not know
how" and not mistakes, at least for the most part, made by himself<ins
title="In the original, the question mark followed 'he did not know
how'">?</ins></p>

<p>In whatever way it happened, he had an opportunity of correcting his
lives, of augmenting them, and again printing them, accompanied by
portraits of the artists. After publication of the first edition he had
availed himself of the manuscripts of Ghiberti, of Domenico Ghirlandaio,
of Raffaello d'Urbino; and had himself collected a number of anecdotes
in his different journeys through Italy. He undertook a new tour in
1566, to prepare for the new edition, as he informs us in the life of
Benvenuto Garofolo; he again examined the works of different masters,
and obtained new information from his friends, some of whom he mentions
by name, when treating of the artists of Forli and Verona. He would have
been still more full of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241"
id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>anecdote in his Lives, had his success
corresponded with his diligence. On this account, in the beginning and
at the end of the Life of Carpaccio, he laments that "he was not able to
obtain every particular of many artists;" nor to possess their
portraits; and he "entreats us to accept what he is able to offer,
although he cannot give all he might desire." He republished his Lives
in 1568, and affirmed in the Dedication to Cosmo I. that "as for himself
he wished for nothing more in them." The new edition issued from the
press of the Giunti; of the additions, consisting of fine observations
upon philosophy and Christian morality, which cannot be ascribed to
Giorgio, part was supplied by Borghini, and still more by Father D.
Silvano Razzi, a Camalduline monk, as Bottari conjectures in his
Preface,<a name="fnanchor_194" id="fnanchor_194"></a><a
href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> but it does not
follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg
242]</a></span> that they assisted in correcting the work. It is full of
errors; sometimes in the grammatical construction, often in the names,
and frequently in the dates; and though it was reprinted at Bologna, in
1648; at Rome, with the notes and corrections of Bottari, in 1759; in
Leghorn and Florence, in 1767, with fresh notes and additions by the
same; and lastly, in Siena, with those of P. della Valle; it still
remains not so much a judicious selection of facts, as a mass of
chronological emendations, some of which shall be noticed in the
sequel.<a name="fnanchor_195" id="fnanchor_195"></a><a
href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>This, if I am not deceived, is the objection that can be most
frequently, and almost continually urged against the work. The other
strictures to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243"
id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>met with in authors are, for the most
part, exaggerations of writers, offended at Vasari for his silence or
his criticisms, on the works of the artists of their country. There is
nothing so flattering to the vanity of an author, as defending the
character of his native place, and of those citizens who have rendered
her illustrious. In whatever manner he writes, all his countrymen, who
are all the world to him, think him in the right; and in the
coffeehouses he frequents, in the shops of the booksellers, and in all
public places, they hail him as the public advocate. Hence we need not
be surprised that such an author writes as if his country had appointed
him her champion, assumes a spirit of hostility, and then the transition
is easy from a just defence to an injurious attack. From such causes
some writers appear to me actuated by unbecoming enmity to Vasari. The
passages of the first edition, cancelled in the second, have been quoted
against him; he has incurred odium for some deformed portraits, as if he
was accountable for the defects of nature; his most innocent expressions
have been tortured into a sinister meaning; his enemies would have us
believe that, intending to exalt his darling Florentines, he neglected
the other Italian artists, as if, in order to do justice to these, he
had not travelled and sought for information, although often in vain, as
I before mentioned. The historians of all the other schools have used
him as the commentators of Virgil treated Servius; all have abused him,
and all <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg
244]</a></span>have availed themselves of his labours. For if all the
information collected by Vasari concerning the old masters of the
Venetian, Bolognese, and Lombard schools be taken away, how imperfect
does their history remain? In my opinion, therefore, he deserves our
best thanks for what he has done, and much forbearance for what he has
omitted.</p>

<p>If his judgment appears less accurate on some artists of a different
school, he ought not, on that account, to be taxed with malignity and
envy, as is well observed by Lomazzo. He has protested that he has done
his best to adhere to truth, or to what he believed to be true,<a
name="fnanchor_196" id="fnanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196"
class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and it is sufficient to read him without
prejudice to give him credit for such justification. He seems a man who
writes as he thinks. Thus, he bestows commendations upon Baldinelli and
upon Zuccaro, his enemies,<a name="fnanchor_197"
id="fnanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
as well as upon his friends: he distributes censure and praise with an
equal hand to Tuscan and other artists. If he discovers painters of
little merit in other schools, he finds them also in that of Florence;
if he relates the jealousies of foreign artists, he does not conceal
those of the Florentines, of which he speaks with a playful freedom in
the Life of Donatello, in his own, and more especially in that of Pietro
Perugino. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg
245]</a></span>His partial criticisms therefore on certain artists arose
less from his nationality, than from other causes. It is certain that he
saw but little of some masters; his opinion of others was formed upon
incorrect information; and he could not attain the same certainty that
we now boast, on what related to a number of artists then living, who,
as usually happens, were then more censured than admired. Some allowance
too should be made for his other avocations; by the multiplicity of
which he doubtless wrote as he painted, with the expedition of his mode
of practice. A proof of this is afforded by the repetitions that occur,
as we have before observed, in successive passages, and the
contradictory characters he sometimes gives of the same picture,
pronouncing it good in one sentence, and in another allowing it scarcely
the praise of mediocrity. This was particularly the case in regard to
Razzi, towards whom he seems to have entertained ill will; arising,
however, more from the bad reputation of the man than from prejudice
against the school of the artist. For the incorrectness of such
censures, in which he, however, was sincere, I blame his maxims of art,
and the age in which he lived. He reckoned Bonarruoti the greatest
painter that had ever existed;<a name="fnanchor_198"
id="fnanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
and exalted him above the ancient Greeks,<a name="fnanchor_199"
id="fnanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
and, from his practice, held a bold and vigorous design as the summit of
perfection in painting; compared to which, beauty <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>and
colouring were nothing.<a name="fnanchor_200" id="fnanchor_200"></a><a
href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> From such fundamental
principles proceeded some of his obnoxious criticisms on Bassano,
Tiziano, and on Raffaello himself. But is this the effect of his
malignity, or of his education? Does it not happen in philosophy as in
painting, that every one gives a decided preference to those of his own
sect. Has not Petrarca generalized the observation, when he asks,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i8">&mdash;&mdash;"Or che è questo</span>
<span class="i0">Che ognun del suo saper par che si appaghi?"</span>
</div>

<p>We may, then, forgive in Vasari what appeared to this philosophic
poet a weakness of human nature; and may observe on a few passages in
his work what was applied to Tacitus; that we condemn his principles,
but admire his history. Such, I believe, was the opinion of Lomazzo, who
though not wholly satisfied with the opinions of Vasari, not only
excused but defended him;<a name="fnanchor_201" id="fnanchor_201"></a><a
href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> and in this he acted
properly.</p>

<p>Vasari is, moreover, the father of the history of painting, and has
transmitted to us its most precious materials. Educated in the most
auspicious era of the art, he has in some measure perpetuated the
influence of the golden age. In perusing his <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>Lives, I fancy myself
listening to the individuals of whom he has collected the traditions and
the precepts. It was thus, think I, that Raffaello and Andrea imparted
these facts to their scholars; thus spoke Bonarruoti; the friends of
Giorgio heard this from Vinci and Porta, and in this manner must have
related it to him. I am delighted with the facts, and also with the
luminous, simple, and natural manner in which they are expressed,
interwoven with the technical terms that originated in Florence, and
worthy of every writer whose subject is the fine arts. Finally, should I
discover in him any prejudice of education, or, if you will, arising
from self-love, it seems to me unjust on account of such a fault, to
forget his many services, and to declare hostilities against him for
such blemishes.</p>

<p>Another service Vasari conferred on the fine arts yet remains to be
noticed, and that is the establishment of the Academy of Design in
Florence, about the year 1561, principally through his exertions. The
society of S. Luke there existed from the fourteenth century, but it had
fallen into decay, and was almost extinct, when F. Gio. Angiolo
Montorsoli Servita, a celebrated statuary, conceived the design of
reviving it. He communicated his idea to Giorgio, who so effectually
recommended it to Cosmo I., that, shortly after, it arose with new
vigour, and became at the same time a charitable institution and an
academy of the fine arts. The prince wished to be considered its head,
and D. Vincenzio Borghini was appointed his <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>representative in
transacting his ordinary business, which situation was afterwards filled
by Cav. Gaddi, by Baccio Valori, and successively by some of the most
accomplished gentlemen of the city; an arrangement maintained by the
sovereigns down to the present day. The chapter house of the Nunziata,
"decorated with the sculpture and pictures of the best masters" of the
age, was granted to this college of artists for a hall, as we are
informed by Valori.<a name="fnanchor_202" id="fnanchor_202"></a><a
href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Another place was
assigned for their meetings, and they have frequently experienced the
liberality of succeeding princes. Their rules were drawn up by the
restorers of this institution, of whom Vasari was one. He wrote
concerning it to Michelangiolo,<a name="fnanchor_203"
id="fnanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
and asserted that every member of this academy "was indebted to him for
what he knew;" and indeed this academy in all its branches partakes
strongly of his style. A similar doctrine, as we have observed, already
prevailed at Florence; but it would have been better that every one
followed the master whom his genius pointed out. In the choice of a
style nature ought to direct, not to follow; every one should make his
election according to his talents. It is true that the error of the
Florentines is common to other nations; and has given rise to an
opinion, that academies have had a baneful influence on the arts; since
they have only tended to constrain all to follow <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>the
same path; and hence Italy is found fruitful in adherents to systems,
but barren in true painters. To me the institution of academies has
always appeared highly useful, when conducted on the plan of that of the
Caracci, of which we shall treat under their school. In the mean time I
return to the Florentine school.</p>

<p>The contemporaries of Vasari were Salviati and Jacopo del Conte, both
of whom lived also with Andrea del Sarto, and Bronzino, the scholar of
Pontormo. Like Giorgio, their genius led them to an imitation of
Michelangiolo. Francesco de' Rossi, called Salviati, from the surname of
his patron, was the <ins title="hyphenated word in the original">fellow
student</ins> of Vasari, under Andrea del Sarto and Baccio Bandinelli.
The last mentioned artist was an excellent sculptor, who usually taught
design to students in painting, an art which, like Verrocchio, he
sometimes practised for amusement. While at Rome, Salviati, contracting
an intimate friendship with Giorgio, pursued the same studies, and
adopted the same fundamental principles of the art. He finally became a
painter more correct, more elevated, and more spirited than his
companion, and Vasari classes him among the best artists then in Rome.
There he was employed in the palace of his patron, in the Farnese and
Riccio palaces, in the Chancery, in the church of S. Gio. Decollato, and
in various other places, where he filled extensive walls with historical
frescos, an employment which was his chief delight. His invention was
very fertile, his compositions <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250"
id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>varied, his architecture grand; he is
one of the few who have united celerity of execution with scientific
design, in which he was deeply versed, although occasionally somewhat
extravagant. His best production now in Florence is the battle and
triumph of Furius Camillus, in the saloon of the old palace, a work full
of spirit, that appears from the representations of armour, draperies,
and Roman customs, conducted by an able antiquary. There is also in the
church of Santa Croce, a Descent from the Cross; to him a familiar
subject, which he repeated at the Panfili palace at Rome, and in the
<i>Corpus Domini</i> at Venice; and it may be seen in some private
collections, in which his Holy Families and portraits are not rare. The
octagonal picture of Psyche, in the possession of the Grimani family, is
highly celebrated, and Giorgio pronounces it the "finest picture in all
Venice." His remark would have been less invidious, had he said it was
the most scientific in design; but who can concede to him that it
appeared a paragon in that city? The features of <ins title="'Pysche' in
the original.">Psyche</ins> have nothing uncommon; and the whole, though
well composed, and adorned with a beautiful landscape, and an elegant
little temple, cannot be compared to the charming compositions of
Tiziano, or of Paolo Veronese, in which we sometimes behold, as Dante
would express it, "the whole creation smile." The design of Salviati was
better than his colouring; and on this account he did not meet with
success at Venice; on his going to France he was but little<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
employed, and is now less sought after and esteemed than Tiziano or
Paolo. In ornamental arts such as poetry and painting, it would seem
that mankind are more easily contented with a mediocrity in knowledge,
than with mediocrity in the art of pleasing. It was very correctly
observed by Salvator Rosa, when requested to give his opinion upon the
relative merits of design and colouring, that he had been able to meet
with many Santi di Tito in the shops of the suburbs, at a very low
price, but that he had never seen there a single specimen of Bassano.
Salviati was the best artist of this epoch, and if he was little
employed at Florence, according to Vasari, it arose partly from the envy
of malevolent persons, partly from his own turbulent, restless, and
haughty demeanour. He trained up, however, some artists who belong to
this school. Francesco del Prato, an eminent goldsmith, and an excellent
artist in the inlaying of metals, when advanced in life, imbibed the
love of painting from Salviati, and became his pupil. Having a good idea
of design, he was soon able to execute cabinet pictures; two of which,
the Plague of Serpents and the Limbo, are pronounced most beautiful by
Vasari. It is not improbable that some of the minor pictures ascribed to
Salviati may be the work of this artist, who is as little named as if he
had never existed. Bernardo Buontalenti, a man of rare and universal
genius, was instructed in miniature painting by Clovio, and had
Salviati, Vasari, and Bronzino, for his masters <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>in the other branches
of painting. He was so successful that his works were in request by
Francis I., by the emperor, and the king of Spain. His portrait is in
the royal gallery, besides which little in Florence can be ascribed to
him with certainty, for he dedicated his time chiefly to architecture
and to hydrostatics. Ruviale Spagnuolo, Domenico Romano, and Porta della
Garfagnana, belong to the school of Salviati. We shall notice the last
among the Venetians, among whom he lived. In the treatise of Lomazzo,
Romolo Fiorentino is assigned to the same school; the individual
conjectured by P. Orlandi to be the Romolo Cincinnato, a Florentine
painter, employed by Philip II. of Spain. He is very honourably
mentioned by Palomino, together with his sons and pupils, Diego and
Francesco, both eminent artists favoured by Philip IV. and Pope Urban
VIII. by whom they were knighted.</p>

<p>Jacopino del Conte, who is also noticed in the <i>Abecedario
Pittorico</i>, under the name of Jacopo del Conte, and considered not as
the same individual, but as two distinct artists, was little employed in
Florence, but in great request in Rome. He was eminent as a portrait
painter to all the Popes and the principal nobility of Rome, from the
time of Paul III. to that of Clement VIII., in whose pontificate he
died. His ability in composition may be discovered in the frescos in S.
Gio. Decollato, and especially in the picture of the Deposition in that
place, a work which is reckoned among his <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>finest productions.
There the competition of his most distinguished countrymen stimulated
his exertions for distinction. He was an imitator of Michelangiolo, but
in a manner so free, and a colouring so different, that it seems the
production of another school. Scipione Gaetano, whom we shall consider
in the third book of our history, was his scholar. Of Domenico Beceri, a
respectable pupil of Puligo, and of some others of little note, I have
nothing further to add.</p>

<p>Angiolo Bronzino was another friend of Vasari, nearly of the same
age, and was enumerated among the more eminent artists, from the grace
of his countenances, and the agreeableness of his compositions. He is
likewise esteemed as a poet. His poems were printed along with those of
Berni; and some of his letters on painting are preserved in the
collection of Bottari.<a name="fnanchor_204" id="fnanchor_204"></a><a
href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Although the scholar and
follower of Pontormo, he also recals Michelangiolo to our recollection.
His frescos in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254"
id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>old palace are praised, adorning a
chapel, on the walls of which he represented the Fall of Manna, and the
Scourge of the Serpents, histories full of power and spirit; although
the paintings on the ceiling do not correspond with them, being
deficient in the line of perspective. Some of his altar-pieces are to be
seen in the churches of Florence, several of them feebly executed, with
figures of angels, whose beauty appears too soft and effeminate. There
are many, on the other hand, extremely beautiful, such as his Pietà at
S. Maria Nuova, and likewise his Limbo at Santa Croce, in an altar
belonging to the noble family of Riccasoli. This picture is better
suited for an academy of design, from the naked figure, than for a
church; but the painter was too much attached to Michelangiolo to avoid
imitating him even in this error. This picture has been lately very well
repaired. Many of his portraits are in Italian collections of paintings,
which are praiseworthy for their truth and spirit; but their character
is frequently diminished by the colour of the flesh, which sometimes
partakes of a leaden hue, at other times appears of a dead white, on
which the red appears like rouge. But a yellowish tint is the
predominant colour in his pictures, and his greatest fault is a want of
relief.</p>

<p>The succeeding artists, who are chiefly Florentines, are named by
Vasari in the Obsequies of Bonarruoti, in the memoirs of the
academicians, written about the year 1567, and in several other<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
places. Their works are scattered over the city, and many of them are to
be found in the cloister of S. Maria Novella. If these semicircular
pictures had not been retouched and altered, this place would be, with
regard to this epoch, what the cloister of the Olivetines in Bologna is
to that of the Caracci; an era, indeed, more auspicious for the art, but
not more interesting in an historical point of view. Another collection,
of which I have spoken in my description of the tenth cabinet of the
royal gallery, is better preserved, and indeed is quite perfect. It now
occupies another apartment. It consists of thirty-four fabulous and
historical pictures, painted on the panels of a writing desk for Prince
Francesco,<a name="fnanchor_205" id="fnanchor_205"></a><a
href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> by various artists of
this epoch. Vasari, to whom the work was entrusted, there represented
Andromeda delivered by Perseus, and procured the assistance of the
academicians, who thus emulated each other, and strove to recommend
themselves to the court. Most of them have put their names to their
work;<a name="fnanchor_206" id="fnanchor_206"></a><a
href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and, if the defects
common to that age, or peculiar to the individual, are here and there
visible in the work, it demonstrates that the light of painting was not
yet extinguished in Florence. Nevertheless, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>I advise him who
examines this collection, to suspend his judgment on the merits of those
artists until he has considered their other productions in their own
country or at Rome, where some of them have a place in the choicest
collections. They may be divided in several schools: we shall begin with
that of Angiolo.</p>

<p>Alessandro Allori, the nephew and pupil of Bronzino, whose surname he
sometimes inscribed on his pictures, is reckoned inferior to his uncle.
Wholly intent upon anatomy, of which he gave fine examples in the
Tribune of the Servi, and on which he composed a treatise for the use of
painters, he did not sufficiently attend to the other branches of the
art. Some of his pictures in Rome, representing horses, are beautiful;
and his sacrifice of Isaac, in the royal museum, is coloured almost in
the Flemish style. His power of expression is manifested by his picture
of the Woman taken in Adultery in the church of the Holy Spirit. He was
expert in portrait painting; but he abused this talent by introducing
portraits in the modern costume in ancient histories, a fault not
uncommon in that age. On the whole his genius appears to have been equal
to every branch of painting; but it was unequally exercised, and
consequently unequally expanded. He painted much for foreigners, and
enjoyed the esteem of the ducal family, who employed him to finish the
pictures at Poggio a Caiano, begun by Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio,
and Pontormo, and by them left <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257"
id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>more or less imperfect. Opposite to
these pictures he painted, from his own invention, the Gardens of the
Hesperides, the Feast of Syphax, and Titus Flaminius dissuading the
Etolians from the Achæan league; all which historical subjects, as well
as those of Cæsar and Cicero, were chosen as symbols of similar events
in the lives of Cosmo and Lorenzo de' Medici. Such was the manner of
thinking in that age; and moderns personified in ancient heroes obtained
a less direct, but higher honour from the art. Giovanni Bizzelli, a
disciple of Alessandro, of middling talents, painted in S. Gio.
Decollato, at Rome, and in some Florentine churches. Cristofano, a son
of Alessandro, became eminent; but he is to be considered hereafter.</p>

<p>Santi Titi, of Città San Sepolcro, a scholar of Bronzino and Cellini,
studied long at Rome, whence he returned, with a style full of science
and of grace. His beautiful is without much of the ideal; but his
countenances exhibit a certain fulness, an appearance of freshness and
of health, that is surpassed by none of those who took nature for their
model. Design was his characteristic excellence; and for this he was
commended by his imitator, Salvator Rosa. In expression he has few
superiors in other schools, and none in his own. His ornaments are
judicious; and having practised architecture with applause, he
introduced perspectives, that gave a dignity and charm to his
compositions. He is esteemed the best painter of this epoch, and belongs
to it rather from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258"
id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>time in which he lived than his style;
if we except his colouring, which was too feeble, and without much
relief. Borghini, at once his critic and apologist, remarks that even in
this department he was not deficient, when he chose to exert himself;
and he seems to have studied it in the Feast of Emmaus, in the church of
the Holy Cross at Florence, in the Resurrection of Lazarus, in the
cathedral of Volterra, and in a picture at Città di Castello, in which
he represents the faithful receiving the Holy Spirit from the hands of
the Apostles; a painting that may be viewed with pleasure, even after
the three by Raffaello which adorn that city.</p>

<p>Among his numerous pupils in design, we may reckon his son Tiberio;
but this artist attended less to the pursuits of his father, than to
painting small portraits in vermilion, in which he had singular merit;
these were readily received into the collection formed by Cardinal
Leopold, which now forms a single cabinet in the royal museum. Two other
Florentines are worthy of notice, viz. Agostino Ciampelli, who
flourished in Rome under Clement VIII.; and Lodovico Buti, who remained
at Florence. They resemble twins by the similarity between them; less
scientific, less inventive, and less able in composition, than Titi,
they possessed fine ideas, were correct in design, and cheerful in their
colouring, beyond the usage of the Florentine school; but they were
somewhat crude, and at times profuse in the use of red tints not
sufficiently <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg
259]</a></span>harmonized. Frescos by the first may be seen in the
Sacristy at Rome, and the chapel of S. Andrea al Gesù, and an oil
painting of the Crucifixion at S. Prassede, in his best manner. A
Visitation, with its two companions, at S. Stephen of Pescia, may be
reckoned among his choicest works; to which the vicinity of Tiarini does
little injury. The second may be recognised by a picture of the miracle
of the loaves and fishes, abounding in figures, which is in the royal
gallery. Baccio Ciarpi, a pupil of the same school, is celebrated as the
master of Berrettini, and deserves to be commended for his diligence and
correctness. He was thought worthy of being employed at La Concezione at
Rome, a most splendid gallery, painted by the greatest artists of that
age. A portrait of one Andrea Boscoli, his pupil and imitator, remains
in the royal museum of Florence, and many of his paintings with horses
are dispersed through the city. He travelled into different parts,
leaving various specimens of his art in different countries, at S.
Ginesio, at Fabriano, and other places in the district of Piceno. His
largest work is a S. John the Baptist in the attitude of prayer, at the
Teresiani of Rimino; a picture that shews invention, but it was unknown
to Baldinucci, who compiled anecdotes of this artist. Constantino de'
Servi is conjectured by Baldinucci to be a scholar of Titi. He is well
known to have been originally his imitator, and having gone into
Germany, there adopted the style of Pourbus. In foreign countries <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>he
seems to have painted few portraits, a branch in which he had greater
merit than employment. His celebrity was greater as a master architect
and engraver of gems, as we shall notice in a subsequent epoch. In
closing the account of the school of Santi, it may be proper to observe,
that his example reclaimed a great proportion of the succeeding
generation, and inclined artists to mitigate the severity of the style
of Michelangiolo, by introducing more grace in the contours, and a
better taste in the heads.</p>

<p>Batista Naldini holds the third rank among the scholars of Bronzino.
He was first the pupil of Pontormo, afterwards of Bronzino, and having
resided some time at Rome, he was chosen by Vasari as the companion of
his labours in the old palace, and retained by him about fourteen years.
The historian makes honourable mention of Naldini, even when a young
man, and denominates him a painter skilful and vigorous, expeditious and
indefatigable. Naldini obtained similar praise in Rome from Baglione,
especially for the chapel of John the Baptist, at Trinità de' Monti,
which he painted with the history of the saint. He painted many pictures
in his native city, some of which, as the taking down from the Cross,
and the Purification of the Virgin, are commended by Borghini for the
colouring and the design, for the disposition, the perspective, and the
attitudes. The defects observable in most of his pictures are, that the
knees are rather too much swollen, the eyes too open, and marked <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>with
a certain fierceness, by which he may be generally recognized; his
colouring is also characteristic, and those changeable hues in which he
delighted more than any other artist of the age.</p>

<p>He taught according to the method then pursued by most masters, which
was to employ his scholars in designing after the chalk drawings of
Michelangiolo, and to give them his own finished pictures to copy; for,
like bees, artists were exceedingly anxious to work in secret, and ready
to wound all who overlooked them. Baldinucci has recorded several
instances of this peculiarity. From these circumstances the fault of the
scholars of Naldini was stiffness, the common failing of that age; they
had little of that free touch and taste in colouring which he possessed,
but yet they deserve to be recorded. Giovanni Balducci, called also
Cosci, from the surname of his maternal uncle, was long his assistant.
His Last Supper in the cathedral, the Finding of the Cross at the
Crocetta, his historical compositions in the cloister of the Domecans at
Florence, and in S. Prassede at Rome, prove his genius to have been more
refined than that of his master. To second the latter, he now and then,
perhaps, went beyond his province, and to some, his attitudes at times
appear affected. He resided and died at Naples, and he is deservedly
praised by the historians of that city. Cosimo Gamberucci appears to
have aimed at a totally different object. On examining a great part of
his works, we may say of him, as was observed of the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
ancient artist, that he has not sacrificed to the Graces. He seems
finally to have improved, for he has left some fine pictures, worthy of
the following epoch. Peter healing the lame in S. Pier Maggiore, a
picture in the style of the Caracci, is the work of his hand. The
Servitian monks have a good picture by him in their public hall; and his
holy families and cabinet pictures of a high class are to be met with in
the city. The Cav. Francesco Currado had a still better opportunity of
improvement, for he lived ninety-one years, constantly employed in
painting and in teaching. One of his best pictures is on the altar of S.
Saverio, in the church of S. Giovannino. He was very eminent in small
figures, and in this style he painted the history of the Magdalen, and
especially the martyrdom of S. Tecla, of the royal gallery, which are
works of his best time. In the same school we may include Valerio
Marucelli, and Cosimo Daddi, both artists of some merit; the second is
memorable for his celebrated pupil Volterrano, in whose native place he
married, and two of his altar-pieces still remain there.</p>

<p>Giovanni Maria Butteri, and Lorenzo dello Sciorina, were two other
scholars of Bronzino, and assisted Vasari in the above<ins
title="hyphenated in the original"> </ins>mentioned pictures on the
escrutoire, and in his preparations for festivals. The first imitated
Vasari, his master, and Titi; but at all times his colouring was
inharmonious; the second has little to boast of beyond his design. Both
are honourably mentioned among <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263"
id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>the academicians; as is also Stefano
Pieri, who assisted Vasari in the cupola of the metropolitan church. The
sacrifice of Isaac, of the Pitti palace, is ascribed to him, and it is
the best of his works executed at Rome, which are censured as hard and
dry by Baglione. Cristofano dell'Altissimo, whose talent lay in portrait
painting, may be added to these. Giovio had formed the celebrated
collection of portraits of illustrious men, which is still preserved at
Como, though now divided between the two families of the Conti Giovio,
one of which possesses the portraits of learned men, the other those of
warriors. From this collection, which the prelate styled his museum,
that still existing at Mondragone was copied, and also the collection
now in the Florentine gallery, by the labours of Cristofano, who was
sent for that purpose to Como by Cosmo I. He copied the features of
those celebrated men, but attended little to other circumstances; whence
it happens that the Giovian collection exhibits many very dissimilar
manners, the Medicean one alone; but the features of the originals are
very faithfully expressed.</p>

<p>Michele di Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio instructed many artists in this
epoch. From his school, proceeded Girolamo Macchietti, or G. del
Crocifissaio, the assistant of Vasari for six years, who afterwards
studied for two years at Rome, though already an adept in the art. His
example merits imitation, for that school speaks more to the eye than
the ear; and he who there employs his eyes <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>judiciously, cannot
fail to reap the advantage. After his return to Florence he finished a
few valuable pictures with care and assiduity, among which may be
noticed an Epiphany for the chapel of the Marquis Della Stufa, at S.
Lorenzo, and a martyrdom of S. Lorenzo S. Maria Novella, which is
greatly praised by Lomazzo. Borghini also, after commending the beauty,
the expression, and the picture in general, scarcely found any thing to
censure. It is certainly among the most striking pictures in that
church. Macchietti also went to Spain, and was not a little employed at
Naples and at Benevento, where he is said to have painted his best
pictures. In the Dizionario Storico of the professors of the fine arts
at Urbino (Colucci tom. xxxi.) I find mention that Girolamo Macchietti
produced some battle-pieces for the hall of the Albani at S. Giovanni;
but I see no reason why he should be admitted to a place among native
artists belonging to that city, or to the state of Urbino.</p>

<p>Vasari mentions Andrea del Minga, then a youth, as contemporary with
Macchietti; yet he is reckoned by Orlandi and Bottari, the fellow
student of Michelangiolo. He was among the last pupils of Ridolfo del
Ghirlandaio, when the school was chiefly under the direction of Michele;
and hence he rather followed the latter than the former. His own works
are by no means among the most excellent. In the Prayer in the Garden,
which remains in the church of the Holy Cross, he rivals any of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>his
contemporaries; and hence it is alleged, that he was assisted in this
picture by three of his friends. Francesco Traballesi, mentioned by
Baglione as the painter of some historical frescos in the Greek church
at Rome, was a pupil of Michele, but lived too short a time to do him
honour. The fable of Danaë, on the writing desk, is the work of his
brother Bartolommeo.</p>

<p>About this time lived Bernardino Barbatelli, surnamed Poccetti, an
artist omitted by Vasari in the school of Michele, and in the catalogue
of the academicians; because at that period he painted only grotesques
and fronts of buildings, in which, though he had arrived at great
eminence, he had not the reputation he afterwards attained in Rome as an
architect, from assiduously studying the works of Raffaello, and of
other great masters. He subsequently returned to his native place, not
only a pleasing and graceful figurist, but rich and learned in his
compositions; hence he was enabled to adorn his historical subjects with
beautiful landscapes, with sea-views, with fruit, and flowers, not to
mention the magnificence of his draperies, and tapestries, which he
imitated to admiration. Very few of his pictures on panel or on canvass,
but many of his frescos, remain in almost every corner of Florence; nor
does he yield to many Italian masters in this art. Pietro da Cortona
used to express his astonishment that he was in his time less esteemed
than he merited; and Mengs never came to Florence without going to study
him, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg
266]</a></span>diligently searching after his most forgotten frescos. He
often painted with careless haste, like a class of poets whose minds are
imbued with Parnassian fury and fine imagery, and who recite verses with
little preparation, and with little trouble. He is, however, always to
be admired, always shews facility and freedom, with that resolute and
firm pencil which never makes an erroneous touch; a circumstance from
which he has been denominated the Paul of his school. He often studied
and made great preparation for his works, and corrected his outline as
one would do in miniature painting. Whoever wishes to estimate the
powers of this artist should examine the Miracle of the drowned restored
to life in the cloister of the Santissima Nunziata, a picture reckoned
by some connoisseurs among the best in the city. His fresco works are to
be met with nearly throughout all Tuscany, and his circular pictures in
the cloister of the Servi at Pistoja, are greatly commended.</p>

<p>Maso Manzuoli, or M. di S. Friano, a scholar of Pierfrancesco di
Jacopo and of Portelli, is esteemed equal to Naldini and Allori by
Vasari. Nor will this appear strange to any one who beholds his
Visitation, which, for many years, decorated S. Pier Maggiore, and was
afterwards carried to Rome, where it was deposited in the gallery of the
Vatican. It was painted when he was about thirty years of age; and, in
the opinion of the historian, it abounds with beauty and grace in the
figures, in the draperies, in the architecture, and in every<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
other circumstance. This is his finest work, and is even among the best
of that age. In his other pictures at S. <ins title="'Trinita' in the
original.">Trinità</ins>, in the ducal gallery, and elsewhere, he is
something dry; and may be compared to some writers who, though they
offend not against grammar, are not entitled to the praise of eloquence.
Alessandro Fei, or A. del Barbiere, was his companion, and partly his
scholar. This artist, who painted in private, received his first
instruction in the school of Ghirlandaio, and of Piero Francia. He had a
bold and fertile genius, adapted to large historical frescos, in which
he introduced fine architecture and grotesques. In his pictures he
attended more to design and expression than to colouring; except in some
pieces, supposed to be his last productions, and executed after the
reformation of the art by Cigoli. His picture of the Flagellation in S.
Croce is highly approved by Borghini. Baldinucci admires him, especially
in small historical subjects, such as, amongst the pieces on the writing
desk, are the Daniel at the Feast of Belshazzar, and that of the
goldsmith's art.</p>

<p>Federigo Zuccaro may be reckoned among the instructors of the artists
of this epoch; for whilst employed in painting the cupola of the
cathedral, where Vasari had only finished a few figures at his death, he
taught painting to Bartolommeo Carducci, who became an architect and
statuary under Amannati, and an artificer in stucco under another
master. Carducci acquired distinction by those <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>talents in the court of
his Catholic Majesty, where he was introduced by Zuccaro; and where he
established himself and his younger brother and pupil, Vincenzio. Both
are mentioned by Palomino among the eminent artists who painted in the
court of Spain. Both must be well known there; especially the latter,
who lived but little at Florence, and who painted more pictures when in
the service of Philip III. and Philip IV. than any of his predecessors
or successors. He printed a dialogue in the Spanish tongue, <i>De las
Excelencias de la Pintura</i>, from which Baldinucci has quoted some
passages in the account of this artist.</p>

<p>Of some of the artists mentioned by Vasari as his assistants in the
decoration of the palace, in the preparations for the marriage of Prince
Francesco, in the funeral obsequies of Bonarruoti, or in the collection
of pictures on the writing desk, the masters are unknown; and the
knowledge would be of little consequence. Such artists are Domenico
Benci, and Tommaso del Verrocchio, whom he names in his third volume at
page 873, and Federigo di Lamberto, a Fleming, called F. del Padovano,
whom he had a little before noticed as a new citizen of Florence, and as
a considerable ornament to the academy. Omitted by Vasari, but inscribed
on the writing desk, we find the names of Niccolo Betti, who painted the
story of Cæsar; of Vittor Casini, who there represented the Forge of
Vulcan; of Mirabello Cavalori, who pourtrayed Lavinia Sacrificing, and
also the emblems of the art <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269"
id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>of weaving; of Jacopo Coppi, who there
painted the Family of Darius, and the invention of gunpowder. I suspect
that they were all scholars of Michele; and Vasari has more than once
thus generally noticed them. Perhaps Cavalori is the Salincorno
mentioned in another place, and Coppi is believed to be that Jacopo di
Meglio, who is more severely treated by Borghini than any other in the
church of the Holy Cross; and not without reason; for his <i>Ecce
Homo</i> in that place has all the defects of this epoch. Whether Coppi
is to be identified with this person or not, he cannot be equally
reprehended for his pictures on the writing desk; and in S. Salvator at
Bologna, he produced a picture of the Redeemer Crucified by the Jews,
that might vie with the best pictures in that city previous to the time
of the Caracci, and is yet one of those most full of subject and most
carefully studied. He imitated Vasari in colouring, and in propriety of
invention, in variety of figures, and in diligence in every part, I have
seen no picture of Vasari by which it is surpassed. It bears the date of
1579, together with his name. There is an account of two of his frescos
in the Guida di Roma; one of which, very copious in subject, is placed
in the tribune of S. Pietro in Vincoli.</p>

<p>To the same period belongs the name of Piero di Ridolfo, by whom
there is a large altar-piece, consisting of the Ascension, and bearing
the date 1612; it is supposed that he took his name from the last of the
Ghirlandai, in whose service he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270"
id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>may have been during his early life.
Whoever may be desirous of adding to the list of names, will find a
great number in a letter of Borghini to the Prince D. Francesco (Lett.
Pittor. tom. i. p. 90), in which he suggests a plan for the preparations
of the Prince's nuptials, as well as the artists best qualified to
conduct them. The names, however, I here give would be more than amply
sufficient, were it not my wish to illustrate Vasari by every means in
my power.</p>

<p>After considering the artists of Florence, on turning to the rest of
Tuscany, we find in many places other associates of Giorgio, who,
perhaps, had as many assistants in painting as bricklayers in
architecture. Stefano Veltroni, of Monte Sansavino, his cousin, was a
man of slow parts, but very respectable in the art. He assisted Vasari
in the vineyard of Pope Julius; or rather he superintended the grotesque
works in that place; and followed his cousin to Naples, to Bologna, and
to Florence. I know not whether Orazio Porta, likewise a native of
Sansavino, and Alessandro Fortori of Arezzo, ever left Tuscany; they
appear to have painted chiefly in their native city and its vicinity.
Bastiano Flori and Fra Salvatore Foschi, both natives of Arezzo, were
employed in the Roman Chancery, along with Bagnacavallo, and the
Spaniards Ruviale and Bizzerra. Andrea Aretino, the scholar of Daniello,
lived at a later period, or at least until 1615.<a name="fnanchor_207"
id="fnanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207"
class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg
271]</a></span>About this time Città San Sepolcro was a seminary for
painters, who were either wholly or chiefly educated by Raffaellino; and
from this place Vasari invited not only the master, but several of the
scholars to assist him in his labours. He was greatly assisted by
Cristoforo Gherardi, surnamed Doceno, whose life he has written. This
artist was his right hand, if we may be allowed the expression, in
almost every place where he was much employed. Gherardi followed his
designs with a freedom resulting from a genius pliant, copious, and
natural, adapted to ornamental works. Such was his talent for managing
fresco colours, that Vasari pronounces himself his inferior: but the
grotesques of the Vitelli palace, which are wholly his own, shew him not
to have been more vigorous in his colouring. The oil picture of the
Visitation in the church of S. Domenico, at Città di Castello, is
entirely his own; but Vasari does not mention it. The upper part of the
picture of S. Maria del Popolo, at Perugia, is likewise his; and is no
less elegant and graceful, than the lower part, which is the work of
Lattanzio della Marca, is firm and vigorous. Doceno died in his native
place in 1552; and Cosmo I. honoured his tomb with a bust of marble, and
an epitaph, in which he is said to be <i>Pingendi arte
præstantissimus</i>, and Vasari, who had approved of his labours in the
old palace, is called <i>hujus artis facile princeps</i>. It is written
in the name of all the Tuscan painters,<a name="fnanchor_208"
id="fnanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
and is alone sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272"
id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> to demonstrate the state of this
school, and the taste of Cosmo. After this specimen, it is not
surprising that the prince neglected to have his portrait painted by
Tiziano, whom he would esteem little in comparison to his own Vasari. It
is a true observation that virtues are not hereditary, or, as it is
expressed by the poet, they rarely spring up again in the branches. Leo
X. was the patron of the arts, and he knew how to appreciate them; but
Cosmo encouraged, without possessing taste to discriminate.</p>

<p>The Three Cungi (or Congi, as some will have it) are also claimed by
San Sepolcro. Gio. Batista was the servant of Vasari for seven years;
Lionardo is described to us as an eminent designer, in the life of
Perino, and in that of Zuccaro is said to have been a painter employed
in the pontifical palace about 1560, along with his countryman Durante
del Nero. For a knowledge of the third brother, Francesco, I am indebted
to my learned friend Sig. Annibale Lancisi; and I have since received
more particular information from Sig. Giachi, who gives an account of an
altar-piece of S. Sebastiano, in the cathedral at Volterra, together
with the receipt for its purchase money in 1587, where he is called
<i>Francesco di Leonardo Cugni da Borgo</i>. At Rome we cannot judge
properly of their style, but it may be discovered in their own country,
in the church of S. Rocco, at the convent of the Osservanti, and in
other places. Their compositions display great simplicity, their ideas
are chiefly <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg
273]</a></span>drawn from nature, and they attended sufficiently to
colouring. Raffaele Scaminossi, a scholar of Raffaellino, painted in a
similar but somewhat more lively manner. I learn nothing of Giovanni
Paolo del Borgo, except that he was the assistant of Vasari in his very
hasty labours in the Chancery, about 1545. He cannot be the Gio. de'
Vecchi who painted so much in Rome, as we are informed by Baglione; and
who chiefly excelled at Caprarola, when contending with Taddeo Zuccaro,
and in the church of S. Lorenzo in Damaso, in the various histories of
the Martyr. He appears to have arrived at a later period, as did the
three Alberti, who were of a family in San Sepolcro, abounding in
painters. They went to study at Rome, and easily formed themselves on
the style common to artists in the time of Gregory XIII. There they took
up their abode, and there died, after having executed many works,
especially in fresco, in that city, and also some memorials of their art
in their native country.</p>

<p>The cathedral contains a Nativity by Durante, a subject which he
handled better in the Vallicella of Rome, and which is, perhaps, his
best performance in that city: in others he is often languid, both in
design and colouring, and appears rather a laborious artist than a man
of genius. Cherubino, the reputed son of Michele, and the assistant of
Daniel di Volterra,<a name="fnanchor_209" id="fnanchor_209"></a><a
href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> was a celebrated
engraver <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg
274]</a></span>on copper, and from this art he derived great assistance
in design. Although late in applying to painting, he obtained a name in
those times. His proportions were light and spirited; his choirs of
angels were agreeable and original; his penciling and whole composition
were dexterous and spontaneous. Such is the character of his Trinity in
the cathedral of Borgo, in which place there remains the façade of a
palace, well conceived, ornamented with arms, genii, and other fanciful
devices. He painted the ceiling of the chapel of Minerva in Rome with
various ornaments and figures, on a golden ground; in that city,
however, he generally assisted his younger brother Giovanni, who
introduced a new era in perspective; not only by his works, existing in
the houses of private individuals at San Sepolcro, and other cities, but
by the fresco perspectives which he executed at Rome. He claims
admiration in the sacristy of the church of S. Gio. Laterano, where he
imitated the salient and receding angles of architecture; and still more
in the grand Clementine salon, the most prodigious and exquisite work in
perspective then existing. Baglione highly commends the S. Clement and
other figures with which it is ornamented; and remarks that they are
admirably foreshortened, and are superior to those of Cherubino, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg
275]</a></span>not so eminent in perspectives. Baglione mentions a
Francesco, the son of Durante, who died at Rome. I am uncertain whether
he is the Pierfrancesco to whom we attribute the Ascension, in the
church of S. Bartholomew at Borgo, with some pictures of no great merit
in the church of S. John, and in other places. History mentions also
Donato, Girolamo, Cosimo, and Alessandro Alberti, of whom I can collect
nothing further.</p>

<p>The writers of Prato exalt their countryman, Domenico Giuntalocchio,
pupil to Soggi, in whose life Vasari mentions Domenico more as an
engineer than a painter. He describes him as a correct portrait painter,
but so extremely tardy in his works in fresco, that he became tiresome
to the Aretini, with whom he for some time dwelt. I cannot point out any
genuine picture from his hand; but his memory is still fresh in the
minds of his fellow citizens, because, instead of leaving his native
place ornamented with his pictures, he left 10,000 crowns as a fund to
be appropriated to the education of young artists.</p>

<p>After the death of Daniel, his scholar and relation Giovanni Paolo
Rossetti, retired to Volterra, and, as is attested by Vasari, executed
works of great merit in this his native place; among which we may reckon
the Deposto, in the church of S. Dalmatius. At a short distance from the
city is a place which gave name to Niccolò dalle Pomarance, of the
family of Circignani. Vasari describes him as a young man of ability. He
neglects to inform us <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276"
id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>who was his master; but he appears to
have been Titi, whom he assisted in the great salon of the Belvidere
palace. He grew old in Rome, where he left numerous specimens of the
labours of his pencil, which he employed with freedom, and at a good
price. He shewed himself greatly superior to the artists of this period,
in some of his works, as in the Cupola of S. Pudenziana. Cavalier
Roncalli was a native of the same place; there are pictures by them both
at Pomarance; where there are also some by Antonio Circignani, the son
of the former, an able artist, though little known. All three will again
be treated of in the third book.</p>

<p>Pistoia possessed at the same time two scholars of Ricciarelli;
Biagio da Cutigliano, noticed by Vasari,<a name="fnanchor_210"
id="fnanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
and P. Biagio Betti Teatino, a miniature painter, sculptor, and
historical painter of merit, whom Baglione represents as constantly
employed in the service of the church and convent to which he belonged.
Leghorn gave birth to Jacopo Rosignoli, pupil of an unknown master, who
lived in Piedmont, where his works must be sought. Baccio Lomi, whose
style much resembles that of Zuccaro, remained at Pisa: he owes much of
his skill and of his reputation to his two nephews, as we shall
afterwards relate. Though unknown beyond the limits of his native
country, he must not be passed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277"
id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>over in silence. The Assumption, in the
residence of the Canons, and some of his other pictures, participate of
the hardness of the age, but exhibit very good design and colouring.</p>

<p>Paolo Guidotti distinguished himself in the neighbouring state of
Lucca, as a painter of genius and of spirit, no less than a man of
letters, and well grounded in anatomical knowledge; but his taste was
not polished and refined. He came to Rome in the distracted times of
Gregory and Sixtus, and lived there during the pontificate of Paul V.,
who created him a knight, and conservator of Rome: he further permitted
him to assume the additional name of Borghese, the family name of the
pontiff. Many of his paintings in fresco are preserved at Rome, in the
Vatican library, in the Apostolic chamber, and in several churches: the
artists with whom he was associated, prove that he was reputed a good
artist. Several of his pictures are in his native place; and there is a
large piece representing the Republic, in the palace. Girolamo Massei
pursued a similar track, only confining himself to the art of painting.
Baglione, who gave an account of him, introduces him into Rome as an
artist, already much commended for his accuracy; to which Taia adds,
that he was both a good designer and colourist; so much so as to lead us
to distinguish him from the crowd of Gregorian and Sixtine
practitioners, in the same way that he was chosen by P. Danti to
ornament the chambers of the Vatican; of which more hereafter. He
returned <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg
278]</a></span>to his native place in his old age, not to employ himself
anew, but to die in tranquillity among his friends. Benedetto
Brandimarte, of Lucca, is mentioned by Orlandi. I saw a decollation of
S. John by this artist in the church of S. Peter, at Genoa, which was
but a miserable performance; a single production, however, is not
sufficient to decide the character of an artist.</p>

<p>The name of a Pietro Ferabosco is mentioned only by the continuator
of Orlandi; he is supposed to have been a native of Lucca, though he is
referred to the academy of Rome, where he probably pursued his first
studies; I say <i>probably</i>, because the excellence of his colouring
in the Titian manner, would lead me rather to include him among the
Venetian artists. There are three of his half-length figures, together
with his name, and the date of 1616, reported as being in the possession
of a gentleman in Portugal; where he resided, most likely, a longer
period than in Italy.</p>

<p>We have already noticed some Tuscans who acquired distinction in the
inferior branches of painting; such as Veltroni, Constantino de' Servi,
Zucchi, and Alberti: Antonio Tempesti, of Florence, a scholar both of
Titi and Stradano, was among the first to acquire a celebrated name in
Italy for landscapes and for battles. He practised engraving on copper,
prepared cartoons for tapestry, and gave scope to his genius in the most
fanciful inventions in grotesque and ornamental work. He surpassed his
master in spirit, and was inferior to none, not even <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>to
the Venetians. In a Letter on Painting by the Marquis Giustiniani,<a
name="fnanchor_211" id="fnanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211"
class="fnanchor">[211]</a> he is adduced as an example of great spirit
in design, a gift conferred by nature, and not to be acquired by art. He
attempted few things on a large scale, and was not so successful as in
small pictures. The Marquis Niccolini, the Order of the Nunziata, and
several Florentine families, possess some of his battles painted on
alabaster, in which he appears the precursor of Borgognone, who is said
to have studied him attentively. He most frequently painted in fresco,
as at Caprarola, in the Este Villa at Tivoli, and in many parts of Rome,
from the time of Gregory XIII. Most of the historical pictures in the
Vatican gallery are the work of his hands; the figures are a palm and a
half high, and display astonishing variety and spirit, accompanied by
beautiful architecture and landscapes, with every species of decoration.
He is not, however, very correct; and his tints are sometimes too much
inclined to a brownish hue; but all such faults are pardonable in him,
as being occasioned by that pictoric fury which inspired him, that fancy
which hurried him from earth, and conducted him through novel and
sublime regions, unattempted by the vulgar herd of artists.</p>

"All painters seem to worship him as their great master, prince, and god
of design." It is thus Monsig. Claudio Tolomei writes in a letter to
Apollonio Filareto, towards the end of the fifth book. Such is the
opinion of the artists of the Leonine age, whatever may be the judgment
passed in the age of Pius VI.</p>

We perceive, however, from the context, that his pictures were no less
perfect on that account; and I believe that those compendious means were
more particularly connected with the mechanism of the art.</p>

It is founded also on Vasari's remark, in his Life of Frate: "<i>There
is likewise a portrait by F. Gio. da Fiesole, whose life we have given,
which is in the part of the Beati</i>;" which cannot, observes Bottari,
apply to any other except D. Silvano Razzi, author of the "Vite dei S.
S. e Beati Toscani;" among which is found that of B. Giovanni. But this
indication would be little; or at least it is not all. The document
which clearly reveals the fact, has been pointed out to me by the polite
attention of Sig. Luigi de Poirot, Secretary to the Royal Finances; and
this is in the "Vite de' SS. e BB. dell' ordine de' Frati Predicatori di
Serafino Razzi Domenicano," published after the death of Vasari, in
Florence, 1577. In these, treating of works in the fine arts in S.
Domenico at Bologna, he adds; "we cannot give a particular account of
these histories, but whoever is desirous of it may consult the whole, in
the Lives of the Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, written, <i>for
the most part</i>, by D. Silvano Razzi, my brother, for the Cav. Giorgio
Vasari of Arezzo, his very intimate friend." After such information, we
must suppose that Vasari, having communicated his materials to this
monk, received from him a great number of Lives, that boast such elegant
prefaces and fine reflections; but that he here and there retouched
them; adding things either from haste or inadvertency, not well
connected with the context, or repeated elsewhere. And in this way we
may account for the many inconsistencies to be met with in a number of
Lives, very finely written, but containing passages that do not appear
to come from the same pen, and frequently make the author contradict
himself.</p>

It is to be observed that Bottari wrote principally to mark the changes
that the works described by Vasari had undergone during 200 years. In
regard to the emendations pointed out by us, he declares in the Preface,
that he could not undertake them for want of time, health, books, and
most of all, inclination. However, we are indebted for not a few to him,
and also to P. Guglielmo, though not equally so in every school. Both
are writers of merit; the former by his citations from printed works,
the second for his information of MSS. and unedited authors.</p>

He examines the question, then keenly contested, whether Sculpture or
Painting was the most noble art. He decides in favour of his own
profession: and there are some other letters in that volume on the
opposite side of the question worthy of perusal. Bonarruoti, on being
asked this question by Varchi, was unwilling to give a decision. (See
tom. i. p. 7, and p. 22.) After Bonarruoti's decease the contest was
renewed, and prose and verse compositions appeared on both sides. Lasca
wrote in favour of painting, while Cellini defended sculpture. (See
Notes to the Rime of Lasca, p. 314.) Lomazzo is well worthy of notice in
his Treatise, lib. ii. p. 158, in which he gives a MS. of Lionardo,
drawn up at the request of Lodovico Sforza, where he prefers painting to
the sister art.</p>

<h4 class="p4">FLORENTINE SCHOOL.</h4>

<h4>EPOCH IV.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Cigoli and his associates improve the style of
Painting.</i></div>

<p class="p2">Whilst the Florentines regarded Michelangiolo and his
imitators as their models, they experienced the fate of the poets of the
fifteenth century, who fixed their eyes on Petrarca and his followers
alone; they contracted a strong similarity of style, and differed from
each other only according to their individual talents and genius. As we
have above remarked, they began to exhibit some diversity after the age
of Titi; but they were still languid colourists, and required to be
impelled into another career. About 1580 the period had at length
arrived, when they began to abandon the manner of their countrymen for
that of foreign artists; and then, as we shall have occasion to shew in
treating of this epoch, the Florentine styles became firm and varied.
This revolution originated with two young artists, Lodovico Cigoli and
Gregorio Pagani. We learn from Baldinucci, that, attracted by the
celebrity of Barocci, and a picture which he had recently sent from
Urbino to Arezzo, which is now in the royal gallery at Florence, they
went together to see it; they examined <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>it attentively, and
were so captivated with the style, that they immediately renounced the
manner of their master. Passignano followed their steps, continues
Baldinucci, and Cigoli, in his company, took a second journey as far as
Perugia, when Barocci had completed his celebrated Deposition from the
Cross; but here the historian fell into a chronological error, inasmuch
as Bellori, the accurate writer of Barocci's life, describes his picture
at Perugia as anterior to that at Arezzo by several years. In whatever
way the mistake ought to be cleared up, it is certain that Passignano
promoted the views of Cigoli. Their example turned the rising generation
from the old manner to a more vigorous style. This was more especially
the case with Empoli, with Cav. Curradi, and some of those above
mentioned, who were followed by Cristofano Allori, and Rosselli, artists
that transmitted the new method to their new disciples. They did not,
however, imitate Barocci so much as Correggio, who was the model of
Barocci. Unable to visit Lombardy, they studied the few copies of his
pictures, and still fewer originals, that were to be met with in
Florence, in order to acquire his management of chiaroscuro, a branch of
the art then neglected in Florence, and even at Rome. To this end they
began to model in clay and wax; they wrought in plaster; they studied
attentively the effects of light and shade; they paid less attention to
practical rules, and more to nature. Hence arose a new style which, in
my opinion, is among <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282"
id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>the best hitherto attempted in Italy;
corrected upon the model of the Florentine school; soft and well
relieved on that of Lombardy. If their forms had approached to Grecian
elegance, if their expression had been more refined, the improvement of
painting, which about this time took place in Italy, should have been
ascribed no less to Florence than to Bologna.</p>

<p>Some favourable circumstances assisted the progress of the Florentine
school; among these we may mention a succession of princes friendly to
the art;<a name="fnanchor_212" id="fnanchor_212"></a><a
href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> the readiness with which
the celebrated Galileo imparted to artists his discoveries, and the laws
of perspective; the travels of several Florentine masters to Venice, and
through Lombardy; and the long residence of foreign artists, eminent as
colourists, at the court of Florence. But it was chiefly owing to
Ligozzi, who studied under the Venetian masters, then considered as the
best in Italy, and who animated the old Florentine style with greater
spirit and brilliancy than it had hitherto displayed. After noticing the
good style of that period, we must not omit to mention one less<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
praiseworthy; a sombre manner, which usurped the place of the other, and
at this day renders many pictures of that period of little or no value.
Some ascribe the fault to the method of mixing the colours, which was
everywhere changed; and hence it is not peculiar to the Florentines, but
is found diffused over Italy. It was partly owing likewise to the rage
for chiaroscuro carried to excess. It is the characteristic of every
school of long standing to carry to an erroneous excess the fundamental
maxims of its master: this we have remarked in the preceding epoch, this
we shall find exemplified in every period of painting, and this, if it
were consistent with our present undertaking, we might demonstrate to
have happened in literature; for a good rule extravagantly pursued leads
to the corruption of taste. We shall now direct our attention to the
fourth epoch, in which, omitting the two older authorities, Vasari and
Borghini, we shall chiefly follow Baldinucci, who was acquainted with
the artists we are now to consider, or with their successors.<a
name="fnanchor_213" id="fnanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213"
class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>Lodovico Cardi da Cigoli, the scholar of Santi di Tito, first
awakened his countrymen to a nobler style, as we have already observed.
The additional observation of Baldinucci, that he perhaps surpassed<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> all
his contemporaries, and that few or none derived such benefit as he did,
from the study of Correggio, will not readily be granted by those who
are conversant with Schedone, the Caracci, or even Barocci, when they
chose to imitate the manner of that great master. From the pictures that
have reached our time, Cigoli appears to have acquired a fine effect of
light and shade from Correggio; to have united this to a scientific
design, to a judicious perspective, the rules of which were previously
taught him by Buontalenti, and to a vivacity of colouring superior to
his countrymen, among whom he unquestionably holds a high rank. His
works, however, exhibit not that contrast of colouring, that mellowness
and clearness, that grace in foreshortenings and features, that
characterize the ornament of the Lombard school. In short he was the
inventor of a style always beautiful, but not always equal; especially
if we compare his early works with his pictures executed after his visit
to Rome. His general colouring savours of the school of Lombardy, his
draperies sometimes resemble those of Paolo Veronese, and he often
rivals the bold style of Guercino.</p>

<p>Independent of the great number of his pictures in the royal gallery,
and many in the possession of the noble family of Pecori, there are a
few in some private houses in Florence. The following are his most
esteemed pictures: the Trinity, in S. Croce; the S. Alberto, in S. Maria
Maggiore; the Martyrdom of St. Stephen, in the nunnery of Monte
Domini,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg
285]</a></span> which Pietro da Cortona considers one of the finest
pictures in Florence. Of the same class is the picture which he placed
in the church of the Conventualists at Cortona, in which S. Anthony is
represented in the act of converting an unbeliever, by a miracle of a
mule that is seen kneeling before the holy sacrament: in this piece he
aspired at surpassing any work of art in that highly decorated city. In
the Vatican he painted S. Peter healing the Lame, a wonderful
production, which, among the pictures in Rome, was reckoned by Sacchi
next in excellence to the Transfiguration by Raffaello, and the S.
Girolamo by Domenichino. The Florentine school may well be proud of this
opinion, pronounced as it was by a profound connoisseur, by no means
usually lavish of his commendations. This masterpiece, which obtained
him the honour of knighthood, is, however, utterly ruined by the
dampness of the church, and the ignorance of one who undertook to repair
it: but his frescos in the church of S. Maria Maggiore at Rome still
remain; and there, by some error in perspective, he appears inferior to
himself;<a name="fnanchor_214" id="fnanchor_214"></a><a
href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> nor was he permitted to
retouch them, notwithstanding that he employed both interest and
entreaties to that effect. Fortune, in some degree, persecuted <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>this
great artist; for had those frescos perished, and that oil painting
remained to our times, Cigoli would have enjoyed a higher fame, and
Baldinucci obtained more credit.</p>

<p>Andrea Comodi and Giovanni Bilivert, nearly approached Cigoli;
Aurelio Lomi followed at a greater distance. Of the latter, I shall
speak among the Pisan artists, a few pages further on; and of two
Romans, belonging to the same school, in the third book. Comodi, the
associate rather than the scholar of Cigoli, is almost unknown at
Florence; but there are many of his copies after celebrated masters,
which often pass for originals, both in that city and at Rome. This was
his peculiar talent; in this he was unrivalled; and it employed his best
years. He produced, however, several original works that are highly
valuable for the design, the exquisite finish, and the strong body of
colouring they display. In these we may trace the friend of Cigoli, and
the copyist of Raffaello. They are chiefly Madonnas, and are greatly
admired for the disposition of the fingers, which are somewhat spread
out, for the graceful slender neck, and a certain virgin air peculiarly
his own. The Corsini family at Rome possess a very fine one. Some of his
fresco pictures remain in the church of S. Vitale, in that city; and
there is a picture of the Titular saint in S. Carlo a' Catinari, which
appears dark and cloudy; an uncommon circumstance with so good a
colourist.</p>

<p>Gio. Bilivert is a name which we in vain look<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> for in Orlandi, who
has transformed him into two painters, one of whom he calls Antonio
Biliverti, and the other, in imitation of Baglione, whose knowledge of
him was inaccurate, Gio. Ballinert; both Florentines, and pupils of
Cigoli. Like the preceding artist, Bilivert is not always equal to
himself. He finished some pictures that had been left imperfect by
Cigoli, to whose design and colouring he endeavoured to unite the
expression of Titi, and a more avowed and frequent imitation of the
ornaments of Paolo Veronese. Bilivert is not sufficiently choice in
heads; but he abounds in expression, as may be seen at S. Gaetano and S.
Marco, where there are many of his historical pictures, particularly the
Raising of the Cross, esteemed one of his best performances. Those
pieces which he engaged to execute, and in which he never appears able
to satisfy himself, are repeated by his scholars: sometimes inscribed
with the initials of his name, especially when he himself retouched
them; at other times they are without an epigraph. None of his
productions are so worthy of being copied as Joseph with Potiphar's
wife; which arrests the eye of every spectator in the ducal gallery.
Many copies of it are to be found in Florence; it may be seen in foreign
collections, in the Barberini Palace at Rome, in the Obizzo collection
at Cattaio, and in several other places.</p>

<p>The ornamented style of Bilivert had many imitators, whose works, in
galleries and in private houses, would pass for those of Venetian
artists, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg
288]</a></span>had they greater spirit and a better colouring.
Bartolommeo Salvestrini is at their head; but he was cut off in his
prime, by the plague of 1630, so disastrous to Italy and the art. Orazio
Fidani, an assiduous artist, and skilled in the style of his master,
painted much at Florence; where his Tobias, that was finished for the
fraternity of Scala, but is now removed, is especially commended.
Francesco Bianchi Buonavita was engaged in few public works. He was
chiefly employed in copying ancient pictures, which the court presented
to foreign princes, and in furnishing cabinets with little historical
pieces, that were at that time in great request in countries beyond the
Alps. They were painted on jasper, agate, lapis lazzuli, and other hard
stones; the spots in which assisted in forming the shadows of the
pictures. Agostino Melissi contributed much to the tapestry of the ducal
family, by furnishing cartoons from the works of Andrea del Sarto, and
also some of his own invention. He likewise possessed a genius for oil
painting; in which branch his S. Peter at the Gate of Pilate, which he
painted for the noble family of Gaburri, is particularly praised by
Baldinucci. Francesco Montelatici, by some supposed a Pisan, by others a
Florentine, and surnamed Cecco Bravo, from his quarrelsome disposition,
abandoned the style of Bilivert, or at least mixed it with that of
Passignano. He was a fanciful and spirited designer, and not a bad
colourist. A fine painting of S. Niccolo Vescovo, by this artist, is to
be seen at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg
289]</a></span>the church of S. Simone; but his works are rare in
churches, for he was chiefly employed in painting for private, and
sometimes for royal collections. He died painter to the court of
Inspruck. Giovanni Maria Morandi remained but a little time with
Bilivert, and on going to Rome, adopted the style of that school.</p>

<p>Gregorio Pagani was the son of Francesco, who died young; but was
highly esteemed by his countrymen. He had studied the works of Polidoro
and of Michelangiolo, at Rome, and executed admirable imitations of them
for private gentlemen in Florence. Gregorio himself could scarcely
distinguish them. He received the rudiments of his art from Titi, but
was initiated in a better style by Cigoli. Strangers praised him as a
second Cigoli, whilst his country possessed at the Carmine the picture
of the Finding of the Cross, which has been engraved; but when the
painting, with the church, was consumed by fire, no great work of his
remained in public, except a few of his frescos; one of which, though
somewhat injured by time, is an ornament to the cloister of S. Maria
Novella. He is rarely to be met with in Florentine collections, as he
chiefly painted for foreigners. Of his school I here say nothing: it
only produced one eminent pupil; but this one was so conspicuous that he
may be said to form a new era, as we shall find in the sequel.</p>

<p>Another associate of Cigoli was Domenico da Passignano, the scholar
of Naldini and of Federigo <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290"
id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>Zuccaro, whom he resembles most, from
his long residence at Venice; where he likewise married. He became so
decided an admirer of the merits of this school, that he was accustomed
to say that he who had not seen Venice, ought not to boast that he was a
painter. This circumstance sufficiently accounts for his style, which is
not the most profound, nor the most correct; but it exhibits
contrivance, is vast, rich in architecture and in drapery, resembling
more the manner of Paolo Veronese, than that of the Florentine school.
Sometimes he resembles Tintoretto in his attitudes, and in that oily
colouring which ought to have been avoided; and through which many works
of both artists have perished. This has been the fate of his Crucifixion
of St. Peter, which he executed for the great church in Rome, under Paul
V. and of the Presentation of M. V. which he also painted at the same
place under Urban VIII. Several pictures, however, remain in some
Italian cities, that were begun by his scholars and finished by him,
with a degree of care that hands him down to posterity as a great
artist. A dead Christ, in the chapel of Mongradone, at Frascati, is in
this style; as are an Entombing of Christ, in the Borghese palace, at
Rome; a Christ bearing the Cross, in the college of S. Giovannino, and
some other works of his at Florence. Passignano, his native place,
possesses what is perhaps his most perfect work, in the font of the
Church of the Fathers of Vallombrosa. He there painted a Glory, that
proclaims <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg
291]</a></span>him an excellent artist, and worthy of a place with his
pupils, Lodovico Caracci, the founder of the Bolognese school, and
Tirani, one of its great ornaments. His Tuscan pupils did not attain
equal celebrity. Sorri of Siena, whom we reserve for that school, is the
one best known in Italy; having painted with applause in several of her
cities. Here we must consider those artists connected with Florence.</p>

<p>Fabrizio Boschi is a spirited painter, whose characteristic
excellence appears to consist in novelty of composition, united to a
precision superior to the generality of his school. A S. Bonaventura in
the act of celebrating mass, in All Saints' church at Florence, is much
praised: and, perhaps, his two historical frescos of Cosmo II. which he
painted in the palace of Cardinal Gio. Carlo de' Medici, in emulation of
Rosselli, are superior to any of his other works. Ottavio Vannini became
eminent in colouring and was very attentive to every other branch of
painting; but he was sometimes poor and cold; and although good in each
part of his pictures, was not happy in the whole. Cesare Dandini, a
disciple of several schools, imitated Passignano in design, in
brilliancy, and also in the perishable nature of his colours: he was
diligent in other things, and very assiduous. His best picture is a S.
Carlo, surrounded by other saints, in the church of Ancona: the
composition is fine, and the whole in good preservation. Many works of
this artist, and of Vannini, decorate collections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg
292]</a></span>Nicodemo Ferrucci, the favourite pupil of Passignano, and
the companion of his labours at Rome, possessed much of the boldness and
spirit of his master. By his example he was led to affix a good price to
his pictures, mostly frescos executed at Florence, Fiesole, and for the
State. He died young at Fontebuoni; but many of his works, too good to
be here omitted, still remain in Rome; one of the most esteemed of which
is found at S. Gio. de' Fiorentini, besides two histories of Maria S. S.
which, if I mistake not, have suffered from being retouched.</p>

<p>Cristofano Allori was at perpetual variance with Alessandro, his
father and preceptor, on account of his attachment to the novel maxims
of the three masters we have just commended. In the opinion of many he
is the greatest painter of this epoch. When the excellence he attained,
during a long life, is considered, he appears to me in some degree, the
Cantarini of his school. They resembled each other in the beauty, grace,
and exquisite finish of their figures; with this difference, that the
beauty of Cantarini partakes more of the ideal, and that the flesh tints
of Allori are more happy. This circumstance is the more surprising,
inasmuch as he knew nothing of the Caracci, nor of Guido; but supplied
all by a nice discrimination, and an unwearied perseverance; for it was
his custom never to lift his pencil from the canvass until his hand had
obeyed the dictates of his fancy. From this method, and from vicious
habits that often seduced <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293"
id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>him from his labours, his pictures are
extremely rare, and he himself is little known. The S. Julian of the
Pitti palace is the grandest effort of his genius; and if it is not
among the finest pictures in this magnificent collection, it undoubtedly
claims the highest rank in the second class. His picture of Beato
Manetto, in the church of the Servi, a small piece, but excellent in its
kind, is reckoned the next in merit.</p>

<p>Many young men were sent to be instructed by him in the art of
painting; but few of them remained long: most of them were disgusted at
the dissipation of the master, and the insolence of some of their fellow
students. He formed some landscape painters, whom we shall notice under
their class; and also some copyists, whose labours may boast of hues and
retouching, the work of his hand. Of this class were Valerio Tanteri,<a
name="fnanchor_215" id="fnanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215"
class="fnanchor">[215]</a> F. Bruno Certosino, and Lorenzo Cerrini.
These, and other artists of this school, continued the Giovian series of
the later race of illustrious men, by transmitting to us many of their
portraits, to which he also lent his hand. To them we owe numerous
duplicates of his most celebrated pictures, which are scattered through
Florence, and over all Italy; more especially of that Judith, so
beautifully and magnificently attired, which is a portrait of his
mistress; while her mother appears in the character <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>of
Abra, and the head of Holofernes is that of the painter, who permitted
his beard to grow a considerable time for this purpose. Zanobi Rosi
lived to a later period, and finished some pieces that were left
imperfect by the death of Cristofano; but he never obtained the praise
of invention. The name of Giovanni Batista Vanni is superior to any
other scholar of the school of Allori. The Pisans claim him as their
countryman; Baldinucci assigns him to Florence. After taking lessons
from Empoli and other masters, he attended Allori for six years; and
whilst he imitated this master admirably in colouring, and rivalled him
in design, he also imbibed his lessons of intemperance. Had he conducted
himself with more propriety, and adhered more to fixed principles, the
genius he possessed might have raised him to more celebrity. He visited
the best schools of Italy, and copied on the spot, or at least designed,
the choicest productions of each. Many praise some of his copies of
Tiziano, of Correggio, and of Paolo Veronese: from the works of the two
last he likewise made etchings. Notwithstanding such studies his
colouring degenerated, and he became so much a mannerist, that he has
not left behind him a truly classical work. The S. Lorenzo in the church
of S. Simone, which is reckoned the masterpiece of Vanni, has nothing
uncommon, except it be that the light of the fire invests the
spectators, and gives the picture novelty and surprising harmony.</p>

<p>Jacopo da Empoli, a scholar of Friano, retains<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> in
most of his works the stamp of his early education; but he adopted a
second manner which is not deficient in fulness of design, nor in
elegance of colouring. Such is his S. Ivo, which, among painters of
great name in a cabinet of the ducal gallery, surprises most strangers
more than the other pictures. He executed other works on similar
principles, from which we might infer that he belongs to an era
favourable to the art. Painters cannot, like authors, amend the first on
a second edition of the same subject: their second editions, by which
they should be judged, pass as other pictures superior to their first
performances. Two of Jacopo's pictures in fresco are commended by Moreni
(tom. ii. p. 113), one belonging to the Certosa, the other to the
monastery of Boldrone; both which prove the extent of his ability in
this branch of the art; but after the period of his fall from the
scaffolding in the Certosa, he abandoned this method and devoted himself
wholly to painting in oil. Empoli gave all the beauty and fine effect of
large works to those pleasing pictures he painted for private
individuals, and in this style he was very successful.</p>

<p>This artist taught Vanni the principles of painting; but his greatest
pupil was Felice Ficherelli; a man of the most indolent disposition,
lazy in every occupation, and, as if afraid of disturbing his tongue,
usually silent unless when asked a question: hence he was named Felice
Riposo by the Florentines. He executed few pictures; but what
proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg
296]</a></span> from his studio may be held up as an example of industry
in the art; simple, natural, and studied, without appearing to be so.
There is a picture of S. Anthony by him in S. Maria Nuova, where he
seems to have been directed by his intimate friend Cristofano, whose
work it strongly resembles. He is rare in collections; but always makes
a good figure there by his graceful design, his full body of colouring,
and his softness. The Adam and Eve driven out of Paradise, in the
gallery of the Rinuccini palace, is worthy such a collection. He copied
Pietro Perugino, Andrea del Sarto, and some other masters so well, that
his work might pass for the originals; and to this employment we may
chiefly attribute the exquisite finish of his pictures.</p>

<p>To this period we may assign some other artists, who, from whatever
cause, are, perhaps, less commended by historians than they deserve. Of
this number is Giovanni Martinelli, of whom there is a capital work in
the Conventualists of Pescia, viz. the Miracle of S. Anthony, a subject
mentioned a little above, as having been also executed by Cigoli. His
Feast of Belshazzar, in the ducal gallery at Florence, and his Guardian
Angel at S. Lucia de' Bardi, are pictures of note, but inferior to that
at Pescia. Of the same class also is Michel Cinganelli, a scholar of
Poccetti, who was employed in the metropolitan church of Pisa, where he
ornamented the corbels of the cupola, and strove to emulate the best
Tuscan artists of his age in an historical <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>picture of Joshua. Such
is Palladino, mentioned in the Guide of Florence in reference to a S.
Giovanni Decollato; a work deserving notice, for its freedom from the
beaten track of his school. He seems to have studied the Lombard more
than native artists, and to have been acquainted with Baroccio. I saw
his altar-piece at S. Jacopo a' Corbolini. I suspect that this artist is
the same as Filippo Paladini, pointed out by Hackert, born and educated
at Florence, and who resided in foreign parts. He was compelled to fly
from Milan on account of some disturbance, and took refuge in Rome,
where he was received by Prince Colonna, and being pursued he went to
Sicily, and resided at Mazzarino, an estate belonging to the Colonna
family. There, as well as at Syracuse, Palermo, Catania, and elsewhere,
he left works that display much elegance and fine colouring, but not
free from mannerism, the fault also of the picture above cited at
Florence. Benedetto Veli painted in the cathedral of Pistoia an
Ascension of Christ, placed at the entrance to the presbytery, upon an
immense scale. It is the companion to one of the Pentecost by Gregorio
Pagani, which sufficiently proves that it has no common merit. There
lived some other painters about this time, of whom Tuscany, as far as I
know, retains no trace; but they are recognized in other schools: thus
Vaiano is recognized in the Milanese, and Mazzoni in the Venetian
schools, where we shall give some account of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg
298]</a></span>Last among the great masters of this period I place
Matteo Rosselli, a scholar of Pagani and of Passignano, as likewise of
several old masters, under whom he studied assiduously at Rome and at
Florence. He became so distinguished a painter that he was invited to
the court of the Duke of Modena, and was retained by Cosmo II. Grand
Duke of Tuscany, in his own service. In painting, however, he had many
equals; but very few in the art of teaching, for which he was adapted by
a facility of communicating instruction, a total want of envy, and a
judicious method of discovering the talents of each pupil, and of
directing his progress: hence his school, like that of the Caracci,
produced as many different styles as he had pupils. His placid genius
was not fitted for the conception of novel and daring compositions, nor
for pursuing them with the steadiness that characterizes the painter of
elevated fancy. His merit lies in correctness in the imitation of
nature; in which, however, he is not always select; and there is a
peculiar harmony and repose in the whole, by which his pictures (though
they are generally in a sombre tone) please, even when compared with
works of the most lively and brilliant colouring. He excels in dignity
of character; some of the heads of his apostles, to be seen in
collections, so strongly resemble the works of the Caracci, that
connoisseurs are sometimes deceived. At times he strove to rival Cigoli:
as in his Nativity of our Saviour at S. Gaetano, which is thought to be
his masterpiece, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299"
id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>and in the Crucifixion of S. Andrew in
All Saints church, which has been engraved at Florence. His fresco
paintings are greatly admired: so well do his labours, on the principles
of the past age, preserve their freshness and brilliancy. The cloister
of the Nunziata has many of his semicircular pieces; and that
representing Alexander IV. confirming the Order of the Servi, appeared a
grand work to Passignano and Cortona. He ornamented a ceiling in the
royal villa of Poggio Imperiale with some histories of the Medicean
family. The chamber where this painting was placed was ordered to be
demolished in the time of the Grand Duke Peter Leopold; but so highly
was Rosselli esteemed that the ceiling was preserved, and transferred to
another apartment. His chief praise, however, arises from his preserving
that fatherly regard for pupils, which Quintilian thinks the first
requisite in a master: hence he became the head of a respectable family
of painters whom we shall now consider.</p>

<p>Giovanni da S. Giovanni (this is the name of his native place; his
family name was Manozzi), could boast of being one of the best fresco
painters that Italy ever possessed. Gifted by nature with a fervid and
bold genius, a lively and fertile imagination, celerity and freedom of
hand, he painted so much in the dominions of the Church, and even in
Rome, especially in the church of the Four Saints, so much in Tuscany,
in Florence, and even the Pitti <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300"
id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>palace,<a name="fnanchor_216"
id="fnanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
we can scarcely believe that he began to study at the age of eighteen,
and died when only forty-eight years old. His style is very far from the
solid manner of his master; he carried the celebrated maxim of Horace
"<i>All is allowable</i>" to excess; and in many of his works he
preferred whim to art. Amid choirs of angels he introduced the singular
novelty of female angels; if we may ascribe this to him, and not to the
Cavalier d'Arpino or Alessandro Allori, as some are inclined to do. But
whatever exertions he made (if we may so express it) to discredit
himself, he did not succeed. His spirit is greatly superior to the
conceits of other artists; and his performances at Florence, in which he
bridled his eccentricities, prove that he knew more than he was
ambitious to shew. Among these we may notice his Flight into Egypt in
the royal academy, some semicircular pieces in the church of All Saints,
the Expulsion of the Sciences from Greece, of the Pitti palace, in which
the blind Homer appears groping his way with great nature, as he is
exiled from his native land. It is related of Pietro di Cortona, that on
seeing some one of the works of Giovanni, which did him no credit, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>he
did not therefore condemn him; but, pointing to the piece, only
observed, "Giovanni painted that when he was already conscious of being
a great man." His pictures on panel and on canvass are less admired, nor
are they always exempt from crudity. He had a son called Gio. Garzia,
who produced several fresco works at Pistoia, tolerably well
executed.</p>

<p>Baldassare Franceschini, surnamed Volterrano, from the place of his
nativity, and also the younger Volterrano, to distinguish him from
Ricciarelli, seemed to have been formed by nature to adorn cupolas,
temples, and magnificent halls, a style of work in which he is more
conspicuous than in painting cabinet pictures. The cupola and nave of
the Niccolini chapel, in the church of the Holy Cross, is his happiest
effort in this way; and surprises even an admirer of Lanfranco. That of
the Nunziata is most beautiful; and we must not omit the ceiling of a
chapel in S. Maria Maggiore, where Elias appears so admirably
foreshortened, that it calls to mind the S. Rocco of Tintoretto, by the
optical illusion occasioned by it. His talents excited the envy of
Giovanni da S. Giovanni, who having engaged him as his assistant in the
decoration of the Pitti palace, speedily dismissed him. His spirit is
tempered by judgment and propriety; his Tuscan design is varied and
ennobled by an imitation of other schools; to visit which, he was sent
to travel for some months by his noble patrons of the house of
Niccolini. He derived great advantages <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>from studying the
schools of Parma and of Bologna. He knew Pietro di Cortona, and adopted
some of his principles, which was a thing not uncommon among the artists
of this epoch.</p>

<p>Volterrano painted a great many frescos in Florence, one in the
Palazzo del Bufalo at Rome, and some at Volterra, that are noticed by
Baldinucci. The praise bestowed on him by the historian appears rather
scanty than extravagant to those who duly consider the propriety of his
inventions, the correctness of his design, qualities so rare in this
class of artists, his knowledge of the perspective, of foreshortening
figures in ceilings,<a name="fnanchor_217" id="fnanchor_217"></a><a
href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> the spirit of his
attitudes, the clearness of his graduated, well balanced, and properly
united colours, and the pleasing and quiet harmony of the whole. The
same talents are proportionally evident in his oil pictures, as may be
observed in his S. Filippo Benizi, in the Nunziata of Florence; in his
S. John the Evangelist, a noble figure which he painted along with other
saints in S. Chiara at Volterra; his S. Carlo administering the
communion to those sick of the plague, in the Nunziata of Pescia, and
some of his other paintings that are well finished, which was not the
case with all his works. The same observations apply to his cabinet
pictures, which abound in the ducal palace, and in the houses of the
nobility of Volterra, especially in those of the families of Maffei and
Sermolli.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg
303]</a></span>Cosimo Ulivelli is also a good historical painter; and
his style is sometimes mistaken for that of his master by less skilful
judges; but a good connoisseur discovers in him forms less elegant, a
colouring less strong and clear, a character approaching to mannerism
and to meagreness. We ought to form an opinion from the works of his
best period, such as his semicircular pieces in the cloister of the
Carmine. Antonio Franchi, a native of Lucca, who lived at Florence, is
reckoned by many inferior to Ulivelli; but he is generally more
judicious, if I do not mistake, and more diligent. His S. Joseph of
Calassanzio, in the church of the Fathers of Scolopi, is a picture of
good effect, and is commended also for the design. Another of his fine
works is in the parish church of Caporgnano, in the state of Lucca; it
represents Christ delivering the keys to S. Peter, and I am informed by
an experienced artist that it is the most esteemed of his productions;
many more of which may be found in the account of his Life, published at
Florence, by Bartolozzi. He was painter to the court, by which he was
much employed, as well as by private individuals. He was a moderate
follower of Cortona. He wrote a useful tract on the <i>Theory of
Painting</i>, in which he combated the prejudices of the age, and
enforced the necessity of proceeding on general principles. It was
printed in 1739; and afterwards defended by the author against certain
criticisms made on it. Giuseppe and Margherita, his two sons, have met
with some commendation, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304"
id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>and I am told there is a fine
altar-piece by the former, which adorns the parish church at Borgo
Buggiano. It is retouched, however, by his father, who honourably makes
mention of the fact. I repeat, honourably; because many fathers are
known to have aided their sons with a view of obtaining for them a
reputation beyond their deserts. Michelangiolo Palloni da Campi, a pupil
of Volterrano, is well known in Florence by a good copy of the Furius
Camillus, of Salviati, in the old palace; which was placed by the side
of the original. He resided long, and was much employed in Poland. An
eminent pupil of Baldassare, named Benedetto Orsi, was omitted by
Baldinucci. A fine picture of S. John the Evangelist, in the church of
S. Stephen, at Pescia, his native place, is attributed to him. He also
painted the Works of Mercy, for the religious fraternity of nobles.
These oil paintings were shewn to strangers among the curiosities of
that city; but they were dispersed on the suppression of the order.
There still exists a large circular picture which he produced at Pistoia
for S. Maria del Letto, enumerated by good judges among the finest works
of Volterrano, until an authentic document discovered the real author.
Last in this list I have to mention Arrighi, the fellow citizen of
Franceschini, and his favourite pupil. He has nothing remaining in
public, in which his master cannot boast a great share.<a
name="fnanchor_218" id="fnanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218"
class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg
305]</a></span>After Franceschini, who may be considered the Lanfranco
of the Rosselli, or rather Florentine school, we proceed to Francesco
Furini, who is its Guido and its Albano. Foreigners recognized him as
such: hence he was invited to Venice, for the express purpose of
painting a Thetis, as a companion to an Europa by Guido Reni. He had
seen the works of masters of this class at Rome, and appears to have
aspired at rivalling, rather than at imitating them. His ideas certainly
do not seem borrowed from them, nor from any other artists. He spent a
long time in meditating on his subject, and was accustomed to consider
his picture completed when he had finished his studies for it; so little
time and trouble did it cost him to embody his ideas in colours. Having
been ordained a priest about his fortieth year, and becoming curate of
S. Ansano in Mugello, he executed some pictures truly valuable, both on
account of the rarity of his works and their excellence, for the
neighbouring town of S. Lorenzo. Above all, we may notice with
admiration a S. Francis receiving the Stigmata, and a Conception of the
Blessed Virgin, in which, elevated above mortality, she appears soaring
and resplendent. But his great name in Italy arose from his cabinet
pictures, which are rare out of Florence, and in Florence are highly
esteemed, though considerable numbers of them remain there. His Hylas
carried away by the Nymphs, which he painted for the family of Galli,
and in which he introduced noble figures that are grandly <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg
306]</a></span>varied, is highly celebrated; not to mention the three
Graces of the Strozzi palace, and the many historical pieces and
half-length figures dispersed through the city that are unnoticed in his
life. They chiefly consist of nymphs, or of Magdalens, no less naked
than the nymphs; for Furini was a very expert painter of delicate flesh,
but not one of the most modest. Furini must have had a great number
either of pupils or imitators, as his pictures for private houses before
mentioned, which were copied, are of frequent occurrence in Florence.
They are often of a dusky hue, through the defect of their ground, and
Simone Pignone is made, often erroneously so, their most common author.
He was Francesco's best pupil; very delicate in the colours of his
fleshes, as we may judge from the altar-piece of B. Bernardo Tolomei, at
Monte Oliveto, where the Virgin and the Infant are coloured very
beautifully in the flesh, if not handsome in their features. His picture
of St. Louis, king of France, at S. Felicità, is still more celebrated.
It was much commended by Giordano, and the artist received five hundred
crowns for its execution. In the first volume of Lettere Pittoriche we
are informed, that Maratta only esteemed Gabbiani and Pignone among all
the Florentine painters of his time. He was also praised by Bellini in
the work entitled <i>Bucchereide</i>, where he coins a new term for
Pignone, (a liberty extremely common among our jocose poets,) I know not
how far susceptible of imitation in another tongue: "<i>È
l'arcipittorissimo de' buoni</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg
307]</a></span>Lorenzo Lippi, like his friend Salvator Rosa, divided his
hours between poetry and painting. His Malmantile Racquistato,<a
name="fnanchor_219" id="fnanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219"
class="fnanchor">[219]</a> which is a model of Tuscan purity of
language,<a name="fnanchor_220" id="fnanchor_220"></a><a
href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> is a work less read
perhaps, but more elegant than the satires of Salvator; and is sprinkled
with those graceful Florentine idioms that are regarded as the Attic
salt of Italy. In looking for a prototype among the artists of his own
school, guided by similarity of genius, he made choice of Santi di Tito.
A delineator of the passions sufficiently accorded with the genius of
the poet, and a painter of the choicest design was highly congenial to
so elegant a writer. He, however, added to his style a greater force of
colouring; and in drapery he followed the practice of some Lombard
masters and of Baroccio, in modelling the folds in paper, a practice of
which their works retain some traces. The delicacy of pencil, the
clearness, harmony, and to sum up all, the good taste, pervading his
pictures, demonstrate that he had a feeling of natural beauty superior
to most of his contemporaries. His master admired him, and said, with a
liberality not always to be found among history painters, "Lorenzo, thou
art more knowing than I." His pictures are not very rare at Florence,
although he resided far from it for many years, for he was painter to
the court of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg
308]</a></span>Inspruck. A Crucifixion, among his best performances, is
in the ducal gallery. The noble family of Arrighi possesses a S. Saverio
recovering from the claws of a crab, the Crucifix which he had dropped
into the sea. Baldinucci and the author of <i>The Series of the most
Illustrious Painters</i> have spoken very highly of his Triumph of
David, painted for the hall of Angiol Gaddi, who wished him to represent
his eldest son as the son of Jesse, and his other sixteen children as
the youths and virgins, that with songs and timbrels greet the victor,
and hail the deliverance of Israel. In this celebrated piece, the artist
was enabled to give full scope to his talent for portrait painting, and
to the style approaching to nature, which he loved, without troubling
himself about studied and artful embellishments. It was his maxim to
write poetry as he spoke, and to paint what he observed.</p>

<p>Mario Balassi perfected himself under Passignano, and after the
choicest examples of the Roman and other schools. He was an excellent
copyist of the old masters, and a painter of invention above mediocrity.
Some of his small historical pictures, and a few pieces representing
eatables, are to be met with in private houses; and, above all, there
are many of his half-length figures finely coloured and relieved. In his
old age he changed his manner, and retouched as many of the works of his
youth as he could lay his hands on; but in striving to improve, he only
injured them.</p>

<p>Francesco Boschi, the nephew and scholar of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>Rosselli, was an
excellent portrait painter. In the cloister of All Saints, where his
uncle Fabrizio also painted, there are some of his portraits that seem
absolutely alive, and are executed in fresco so admirably, that they
clearly shew the school from which he proceeded. He finished some pieces
in oil, that were left imperfect by the death of Rosselli, and painted
others entirely his own, the subjects of which were chiefly religious,
where the countenances are strikingly expressive of probity and
sanctity. As he grew older he assumed the ecclesiastical habit, and
sustained its dignity by his exemplary conduct, the account of which
Baldinucci has extended at some length. During twenty-four years in
which he lived a priest, he did not resign his pencil; but he employed
it less frequently, and generally less successfully, than in his youth.
His elder brother Alfonso promised much, and even attained a great deal,
though cut off in early life.</p>

<p>The style of Jacopo Vignali has some resemblance to that of Guercino,
but less in the forms than in the dark shadows and the grounds. He is
amongst those scholars of Rosselli who are seldom mentioned, although he
painted more than any of the rest for the prince and the state. He often
is weak, especially in attitude; often, however, he appears
praiseworthy, as in the two pictures at S. Simone, and in the S.
Liborio, which is possessed by the Missionaries. He is most conspicuous
in fresco painting, with which he ornamented the chapel of the
Bonarruoti. He painted good historical pictures <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>in the palaces of many
of the nobility, and he even boasts noble pupils, none of whom did so
much honour to his memory as Carlo Dolci.</p>

<p>Dolci holds the same rank in the Florentine, that Sassoferrato holds
in the Roman school. Both, though destitute of great powers of
invention, obtained great reputation for Madonnas and similar small
subjects, which have now become extremely valuable; for the wealthy,
desirous of possessing pictures, at once estimable and religious, to
hang up in their oratories, have brought those two masters into great
request, notwithstanding that they operated on very different
principles. Carlo is not so celebrated for beauty, (for he was like his
master, a mere <i>naturalist</i>,) as for the exquisite pains with which
he finished every thing, and the genuine expression of certain affecting
emotions; such as the patient suffering of Christ, or of the Virgin
Mary; the penitential compunction of a Saint, or the holy confidence of
a Martyr devoting himself as a victim for the living God. The colouring
and general tone of his pictures accord with the idea of the passion;
nothing is turgid or bold; all is modesty, repose, and placid harmony.
In him we may retrace the manner of Rosselli brought to perfection, as
we sometimes can view the features of the grandsire in his descendants.
A few of his larger works still remain, such as the S. Antonio, in the
royal museum; the Conception of our Lady, in the possession of the
Marquis Rinuccini; also a very few of his subjects from profane story, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg
311]</a></span>few of his portraits, and the celebrated figure of Poetry
in the palace of Prince Corsini. His small pictures, for each of which
he usually received 100 crowns, are very numerous; and were frequently
repeated by himself or by his pupils, Alessandro Lomi and Bartolommeo
Mancini; and often by Agnese Dolci, his daughter, a good artist and
follower of the style of her father; but not his equal. His two Madonnas
in the cabinet of the Grand Duke, and his martyrdom of S. Andrew, in the
possession of the Marquis Gerini, have been often copied.</p>

<p>Of Onorio Marinari, the cousin and scholar of Carlo, but few pictures
remain at Florence, either in private or in public. After imitating his
master, (which usually is the first exercise of students in the art, and
often, from dissimilarity of genius, is their great bane,) he formed
another style, by yielding to the bent of his natural powers; which was
more grand, had more of the ideal, and deeper shadows; and of this
several specimens remain in the churches of S. Maria Maggiore, and S.
Simone. This artist died young, very unfortunately for the school to
which he belonged.</p>

<p>About the period we have been describing, some foreign artists
resided at Florence for a considerable time, to the no small advantage
of the native painters, as we have already observed. Paggi came there in
the reign of the Grand Duke Francis I., remained there twenty years, and
left some works behind him. About the same time Salvator Rosa, Albani,
Borgognone, Colonna, Mitelli, and many <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>more, either invited by
the princes from abroad, or coming there of their own accord, were
retained by them for the decoration of the palace and the city. We shall
consider them particularly under the schools of the countries where they
were born, or in which they taught; but here we shall give a place to
Jacopo Ligozzi, whom the Florentine school may claim on account of his
residence, his employment, and his scholars. He had studied at Verona
under Paolo Veronese, according to Baldinucci; but under Gio. Francesco
Carrotto, according to the emendation of Maffei, without reflecting that
this artist died when Jacopo was scarcely three years old. Some foreign
writers make him the son of Gio. Ermanno, the painter; a circumstance
unknown to Cav. del Pozzo, the townsman and historian of them both.
Ferdinand II. appointed him painter to the court, and superintendant of
the gallery. This was very honourable, when conferred by such a prince
on him, in preference to many eminent Florentines. Ligozzi executed some
works at Rome, and introduced at Florence a freedom of pencil, an art in
composition, a taste for the ornamental, and a grace and gaiety, till
then rare in that city. His design was sufficiently correct, and
uniformly improved while he remained in Tuscany. As to his colouring,
although it was not that of Paolo, it was not deficient in truth and
vigour.</p>

<p>His seventeen semicircular pictures in the cloisters of All Saints,
are valued at Florence; especially <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>the interview between
S. Francis and S. Domenick, the founders of the order. On this picture
he wrote, <i>To the confusion of our friends</i>, meaning the envious
and malignant. This is his masterpiece in fresco. He painted more
frequently in oil colours in several churches. The S. Raymond in the act
of reanimating a child, in S. Maria Novella, is a picture full of art;
and there is another in the same style at the Scalzi of Imola,
representing the four Crowned Saints. The martyrdom of S. Dorothea, I do
not hesitate to call a wonderful picture; in which we recognize a
follower of Paolo, and which is in possession of the Conventual Friars
of Pescia. The scaffold, the executioner, the Prefect on horseback who
is ordering him to strike, the great crowd of spectators variously
affected, and all the apparatus of a public punishment, strike and
astonish equally the connoisseur and the unskilled in painting; the holy
martyr especially interests us, who, on her knees, with a placid
composure, willingly resigns her life, and is about to receive from
angels the eternal crown purchased with her blood. In other performances
he shews more simplicity, as in the S. Diego at All Saints, or in the
Angels at the P. P. Scolopi; but he is an artist who always pleases, and
who shews that he felt what he painted. Ligozzi painted much for private
individuals. In his very small pictures, a style in which he was expert,
he finished as highly as if they were miniatures. Several of his works
were published by Agostino Caracci, and other engravers.</p>

<p>None of his Florentine pupils is esteemed equal<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> to
Donato Mascagni, for such was his real name, which may be seen
subscribed to two Scriptural pieces, in possession of Sig. Ab. Giachi,
at Volterra. Having entered the order of Servi, he assumed the name of
Fra Arsenio; and several of his works painted after that period are to
be seen in Florence, executed in a manner not very full and soft, but
diligent; of which there are several other specimens in his Miracles of
the Nunziata, which are engraved and illustrated in the little work of
Padre Lottini. What does him greatest honour is the picture preserved in
the library of the monastery of Vallombrosa. It represents the donation
of the State of Ferrara to the Holy Seat, by the Countess Matilda, as is
believed by some, or rather the distribution of some privileges by her
to the order of Vallombrosa, and is a picture full of subject, and the
chief glory of this master.</p>

<p>In casting our eyes over other cities of Tuscany, we find some
painters very capable of decorating houses and altars. Francesco
Morosini, surnamed Montepulciano, may be recognized in the church of S.
Stephen, of Florence, where he painted a Conversion of S. Paul, in the
manner of his master Fidani. Arezzo produced the two Santini. Of one of
them, there named the Elder, several pictures were pointed out to me by
the accomplished Cav. Giudici; among which was a S. Catherine, in
possession of the Conventual Friars: it savours of the Florentine manner
during this epoch; except that the use of changing tints is more
frequent. Bartolommeo and Teofilo Torre, of Arezzo, are<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
noticed as fresco painters by Orlandi, who mentions halls, and even
whole houses, being ornamented by the latter with historical pieces;
which, if deficient in design, he praises for their colouring. Francesco
Brini left a good picture of the Immaculate Conception, at Volterra: of
his country and school I am ignorant. I do not know the master of Pompeo
Caccia; it is certain that he called himself a native of Rome, perhaps
because it is easy to substitute the capital, so well known, for places
in the state of less notoriety. In Rome, however, I do not find any
traces of him. I find, indeed, that he left several pictures at Pistoja;
among which is the Presentation (at the Selesiane) of Jesus in the
Temple, to which is affixed the date 1615. Alessandro Bardelli was a
native of Pescia; in his style we find traces of his preceptor Curradi
and of Guercino. He was a good painter, and executed the ornamental
border for the portrait of S. Francis, painted by Margaritone, for his
church in Pescia: he represented around it the virtues of the Saint, and
a choir of Angels above. I am doubtful whether we should include Alessio
Gimignani, one of a family of artists in Pistoia, to be recorded in the
fifth epoch, among the pupils of Ligozzi, but he was undoubtedly his
follower.</p>

<p>About this period two schools arose, highly deserving of notice,
those of Pisa and of Lucca. The Pisan school recognizes as its founder,
Aurelio Lomi, first a scholar of Bronzino, and afterwards of Cigoli. His
very correct performances, in the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> cathedral of Pisa, are
executed after both masters; but when compared to Cigoli he is more
minute, and has much less softness. His aim appears to be to surprise
the multitude by an agreeable colouring, and a magnificence of draperies
and ornaments. This style pleased at Florence, in Rome, and more
especially at Genoa, where he was preferred to Sorri, many years
established and in good repute. His works in that city are very full of
subject; as his S. Anthony, belonging to the Franciscans, and his Last
Judgment, in S. Maria of Carignano; pictures which surprise by an air of
novelty: the first is graceful, rich, but modest in the tints; the
second terrible, and the colours more vivid than those he employed on
any other occasion. A S. Jerome, in the Campo Santo, is less glowing,
but it is esteemed by the Pisans his capital work; at the bottom of this
piece he put his initials and the date 1595.</p>

<p>He most probably taught the principles of the art to his brother,
Orazio Lomi; who was called Gentileschi, from the surname of an uncle.
Gentileschi formed his style, however, on the finest examples in Rome,
assisted by his friend Agostino Tassi. Tassi was an eminent ornamental
landscape painter, and Gentileschi executed appropriate figures to his
inventions in the Loggia Rospigliosi, in the saloon of the Quirinal
palace, and in other places. He also painted some smaller pictures in
Rome, particularly at the Pace, from which we cannot ascertain his
merit, either because they were performances of his unripe years, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg
317]</a></span>because they have become black from age. He had not then
attained the beautiful colouring, nor the Lombard-like manner of
managing the shadows, which we observe in many of his cabinet pictures.
A fine specimen, representing S. Cecilia with S. Valerian, is in the
Borghesi palace. The choicest adorn the royal palace of Turin, and some
houses in Genoa. In the collection of his Excellency Cardinal Cambiasi,
there is a David standing over the dead Goliath; so relieved, and with
tints so vivid and so well contrasted, that it gives the idea of a style
entirely new. He was esteemed by Vandyck, and inserted by him in his
series of portraits of one hundred illustrious men. When already old he
went to the English court, where he died at the age of eighty-four.</p>

<p>Artemisia, his daughter and disciple, followed her father into that
island; but she passed her best years in Italy. She was respected for
her talents, and celebrated for the elegance of her manners and
appearance. She is noticed both by Italian and foreign writers, and by
Walpole among the latter, in his <i>Anecdotes of Painting in
England</i>. She lived long at Naples, married there a Pier Antonio
Schiattesi; and was there assisted and improved in the art by Guido
Reni, studied the works of Domenichino, and was not unskilled in other
approved styles. She shews variety of style in her few remaining
historical pictures. Some of them are at Naples and Pozzuolo, and there
are two in Florence inscribed with her name; one in the ducal gallery,
and the other in possession of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318"
id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>my noble and learned friend Sig.
Averardo de' Medici; the former representing Judith slaying Holofernes,
is a picture of a strong colouring, of a tone and perspicuity that
inspires awe; the latter, a Susanna and the Elders, is a painting that
pleases by the scene, the elegance of the principal figure, and the
drapery of the others. Artemisia, however, was more celebrated for her
portraits, which are of singular merit; they spread her fame over all
Europe, and in them she surpassed her father.</p>

<p>Orazio Riminaldi was a scholar of the elder Lomi in Pisa, and of the
younger in Rome, but imitated neither of them; from the beginning he
gave himself up to the guidance of Manfredi, in the manner of
Caravaggio, and afterwards became a follower of Domenico Zampieri, to
rival whom he seems intended by nature. From the time that the art of
painting revived in Pisa, that city had not perhaps so eminent a
painter, nor have many better been born on the banks of the Arno, a soil
so propitious to the arts. Grand in contour and in drapery, after the
manner of the Caracci, pleasing and agreeable in his carnations, full,
free, and delicate in the management of his pencil, he would have been
faultless, had not the wretched style of engraving raised prejudices
against him. Excessive fatigue, or, as others will have it, the plague
of 1630, snatched him in early life from his country; for the fame of
which alone he seems to have lived to maturity. He there ornamented many
altars with fine pictures, one of which representing the martyrdom of S.
Cecilia, was afterwards placed in<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> the Pitti palace. In
the choir of the cathedral there are two of his scriptural pieces, that
form a perfect study for any one who wishes to become acquainted with
this epoch. The judgment of the master of the works was conspicuous in
engaging Riminaldi to paint the cupola, even before he had finished the
above pictures, and in making choice of him in preference to any other
artist. The Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which he painted in oil, is
one of the best conceived and most perfect works that Tuscany had ever
beheld, and it was the last labour of Orazio. His brother Girolamo
completed it feebly, by introducing some figures that were wanting, and
the family received 5,000 crowns as its price. Girolamo is rarely to be
met with in Pisan collections, and still more rarely in other places. He
was, however, well known in his day, having been invited to Naples to
ornament the chapel of S. Gennaro, and to the court of Paris by the
queen.</p>

<p>From among many Pisan artists of this period recorded by Sig. da
Morrona, or Sig. Tempesti, we shall select some of the most
considerable. Ercole Bezzicaluva is worthy of notice, both for his
engravings and his picture representing various saints in the choir of
St. Stephen's at Pisa. So likewise is Gio. del Sordo, otherwise called
Mone da Pisa; but his colouring seems superior to his invention.
Zaccaria Rondinosi, I believe, of the Florentine school, was more
skilled in ornamental than in any other branch of painting. He repaired
the pictures <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg
320]</a></span>in the Campo Santo, and on that account was honoured by
the citizens with a tomb there, and near it an inscription on the
marble. I know not whether any picture of Arcangela Paladini, an
excellent embroiderer, except her own portrait, has reached our times.
It was hung in the ducal gallery among the portraits of illustrious
painters: to be deposited in such a place, and to remain there from
1621, is an unequivocal proof of its merit; since it is the custom of
the place not lightly to refuse the portraits of tolerably good
painters, but to keep them there as if only lodgers, and then send them
to some villa of the prince, when new guests arrive, to take a place in
the cabinets which are named <i>de' Pittori</i>. Gio. Stefano Marucelli,
both an engineer and a painter, was not born in Pisa, but he may be
reckoned a Pisan from his long residence and attachment to the place.
Having come from Umbria into Tuscany, according to the tradition of the
Pisans, he became a pupil of Boscoli, and remaining at Pisa, he
contended with the celebrated artists whom we have noticed as employed
from time to time in ornamenting the tribune of the cathedral. The
Abraham entertaining the three angels is a work of his, commended for
felicity of invention, and beauty of colouring. In the church of S.
Nicolas at Pisa, there remains a memorial of Domenico Bongi of
Pietrasanta, who was a follower of Perino del Vaga. He flourished in
1582.</p>

<p>The series of the principal artists of Lucca commences <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>with
Paol Biancucci, the best scholar of Guido Reni, whose grace and full
power of colour he has imitated in many of his works. He sometimes so
strongly resembles Sassoferrato as to be mistaken for him. The Purgatory
which he painted at Suffragio, the picture representing various saints
which he left at the church of S. Francis, two in possession of the
noble family of Boccella, and many others scattered over the city, are
of such merit, that Malvasia should have noticed him among the pupils of
Guido, which he has not done. He has also omitted Pietro Ricchi of
Lucca, who went to Bologna from the school of Passignano. It is true
that the preceptorship of Guido is in this instance doubtful, though
Baldinucci and Orlandi both assert it: for Boschini, who was his
intimate friend, says not a word upon the matter, merely observing that
Ricchi regretted he had not studied in Venice. It is certain he
frequently imitated the forms of Guido; but in colouring and design
adhered to the manner of Passignano; he also imbibed the principles of
the Venetian school, as we shall relate in the proper place. Two of his
pictures are preserved at the church of S. Francis in Lucca, and some
others remain in private hands; small remains of a genius very fertile
in invention, and of a hand most rapid and almost indefatigable in
execution. He painted in several cities of France, in the Milanese, and
still more in the Venetian states, where he died at Udine, in the MS.
guide to which place he is often named.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg
322]</a></span>Pietro Paolini long lived and taught at Lucca; he was a
pupil of the Roman school, as history informs us; but to judge from his
works one would pronounce him of the Venetian. In Rome he frequented the
study of Angelo Caroselli, who was by education a follower of
Caravaggio, but exceedingly expert in copying and imitating every style.
Under him Paolini acquired a manner that shews good drawing, broad
shadows, and firm touches, compared by some to the style of Titian, and
by others to that of Pordenone: one also remarks in his works undoubted
imitations of Veronese. The martyrdom of S. Andrew, that exists at S.
Michele, and the grand picture, sixteen cubits long, preserved in the
library of S. Frediano, would be sufficient to immortalize a painter. In
this he represented the pontiff S. Gregory, entertaining some pilgrims;
it is a magnificent picture, ornamented in the style of Veronese, with
plate and architectural perspective, full of figures, and possessing a
variety, harmony, and beauty, that have induced many poets to extol it
as a wonderful production. His cabinet pictures of conversations and
rural festivals, which are not rare at Lucca, are exquisite. Two, of the
Massacre of Valdestain, belonging to the Orsetti family, were especially
commended by Baldinucci. The historian remarks that he had a particular
talent for such tragic themes, and in general for the energetic; he
admires him less in the delicate, and even accuses him of marking the
action of his female figures <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323"
id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>too strongly. That he could however be
very pleasing when he inclined, we are led to believe from his large
work in the church of the Trinity; which he is said to have conducted in
this graceful style, to demonstrate that he was not inferior to his
rival Biancucci.</p>

<p>It is uncertain whether Pietro Testa, called at Rome Il Lucchesino,
was his disciple; but it appears highly probable, when his age is
compared with that of Paolini, that he learnt from the latter the
principles of the art, which he had undoubtedly acquired in Lucca before
he came to Rome. He there had several masters, and was chiefly under
Pietro da Cortona, from whose school he was expelled, because he treated
the maxims of the master with contempt. He then put himself under
Domenichino, on whose principles, says Passeri, he gloried to rely; but
his style, in his own despite, at times approaches nearly to that of
Cortona. He has also some resemblance to his friend Poussin, both in his
figures (which at one time he made too slender), in his landscapes, and
in his study of the antique, of which he was deeply enamoured; having
applied himself to designing the finest specimens in architecture and in
sculpture that Rome afforded. In this branch he is excellent. The death
of B. Angelo, placed in S. Martino a' Monti, a picture of great force,
is the only piece before the public. Testa is more frequently recognized
in galleries: there is a Joseph sold to the Ishmaelites by him in the
capitol; a Murder of the Innocents, in the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>Spada palace; but there
are not many of his pictures elsewhere; for he engraved more than he
painted.<a name="fnanchor_221" id="fnanchor_221"></a><a
href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> He left some oil
paintings at Lucca, one in a feeble style at S. Romano, several at S.
Paolino, in the Buonvisi gallery, and in other places, in his best
manner. Two of his works in fresco remain there; viz. the allegorical
picture of Liberty in the senate house, and the small very elegant
cupola of the oratory in the Lippi palace. He settled at Rome, where he
lived unhappily, and either from despair, or some affront, drowned
himself in the Tiber. His fate may teach young artists of genius not to
overrate their own talents, nor to despise those of others. By these
failings, Testa alienated the minds of his contemporaries, so that
neither in reputation nor in employment was he so successful as many
others; and his perpetual complaints occasioned doubts even of his
sanity.</p>

<p>Omitting some scholars of Paolini less addicted to his manner, we
shall notice the three brothers, Cassiano, Francesco, and Simone del
Tintore. I find nothing recorded of the first that exalts him above
mediocrity; and when one meets with an indifferent picture of the school
of Paolini, it is ascribed to Cassiano, or some such pupil; or sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg
325]</a></span>to the dotage of Paolini, when he produced sketches
rather than paintings. Francesco is recognized as an able artist in the
Visitation, in the apartments of his excellency the Gonfaloniere; and in
some pieces in the Motroni collection. Simone was expert in depicting
birds, fruit, and other objects in the inferior walks of the art, to
which, as I usually do at the end of each epoch, I shall here devote a
few pages.</p>

<p>And to pursue this pleasing branch of painting, I may observe that
Angiol Gori and Bartolommeo Bimbi of Florence, distinguished themselves
in fruit, and more especially in flowers: the second was the scholar of
the first in this line, and of Lippi in figures. Lippi himself induced
Andrea Scacciati to abandon figures for fruit and flowers, and animals,
in which department he succeeded well, and sent many pictures into
foreign countries. Bimbi was the Mario of his school. He instructed
Fortini, whom we shall notice by and by along with Moro, a painter of
flowers and animals. All these gave place to Lopez of Naples, who
visited Florence in his journeys through Italy, and shall be afterwards
mentioned.</p>

<p>The art of painting landscapes, and their introduction into
collections, began during this epoch: the first style that became
fashionable at Florence was that of Adriano Fiammingo: but Cristofano
Allori excelled all by the neat and firm touch of his pencil, and by the
exquisite figures which he introduced into his landscapes. Guasparre
Falgani <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg
326]</a></span>surpassed him in the number of such subjects: he was
initiated in the art by Valerio Marucelli, and imitated by Giovanni
Rosi, and Benedetto Boschi, the brother and fellow student of Francesco.
The landscapes of this age have often their greens changed into black;
and are reckoned of the old school by Baldinucci. The new style was
introduced into Florence by Filippo d'Angeli, or Philip the Neapolitan,
who was long retained at the court of Cosmo II; but chiefly by Salvator
Rosa. This artist was brought to Florence by Cardinal Gio. Carlo, and
remained there for seven years; where in the capacity of painter, poet,
and author of comedies, he was constantly applauded for his fine genius,
and his society courted by men of learning; with whom, in every
department of letters, the country then abounded. He formed no pupils at
that place, but many young men there became his copyists and imitators;
as Taddeo Baldini, Lorenzo Martelli, and many others. Antonio Giusti, a
pupil of Cesare Dandini, was particularly skilled in this art; but he
likewise practised every other branch of painting; and Orlandi has
described him as an universal painter. Signor da Morrona notices the
Poli, two brothers, who executed many pleasing landscapes, which are
known in the collections of Florence and of Pisa.</p>

<p>Passing from landscape to sea-views, I do not find any Tuscan who in
this respect equalled Pietro Ciafferi, otherwise called Lo Smargiasso,<a
name="fnanchor_222" id="fnanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222"
class="fnanchor">[222]</a> and recorded <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>among the Pisan
artists. It is said that he resided long at Leghorn, a place well suited
to his genius. He there decorated façades of houses with disembarkations
and naval enterprizes; and of such subjects, ports, sea-coasts, and
ships, he composed oil paintings, that are usually highly finished, and
ornamented with small figures, well designed and fancifully draped. He
likewise succeeded greatly in architectural views. Leghorn and Pisa are
rich in his easel pictures; and one in possession of Sig. Decano
Zucchetti of this place bears the name of the artist and the date
1651.</p>

<p>Perspective was much cultivated at Florence about this period; and
the Bolognese had carried it to a degree of excellence, that will claim
attention in the proper place. Lessons in it were given by Giulio
Parigi, an excellent architect; and afterwards by Baccio del Bianco, who
became engineer to his Catholic Majesty Philip IV. Their theoretic views
were seconded by the example of Colonna, who came to Florence in 1638,
along with Mitelli, a native of that place, and remained six years in
the service of the court. After this period Florence produced many
painters of cabinet pieces, and in the ornamental line, or rather a new
school of painting was founded by Jacomo Chiavistelli, a painter of
sound and more chaste taste than was common in that age. One may form an
idea of him in several churches, and in many saloons in the city; as for
instance, in that of the Cerretani palace, which is among his most
elegant works.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg
328]</a></span> He likewise painted for cabinets, where his perspective
pieces are frequently to be met with. Orlandi notices his most
considerable pupils, Rinaldo Botti, and his cousin Lorenzo del Moro,<a
name="fnanchor_223" id="fnanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223"
class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Benedetto Fortini, and Giuseppe Tonelli, who
also studied at Bologna. To these may be added, Angiol Gori, Giuseppe
Masini, and others who assisted him about 1658, in painting the
corridore of the ducal gallery, which is not their best performance. I
find in the anecdotes of Mondina and Alboresi, edited by Malvasia, that
Antonio Ruggieri contended with them in Florence: he was, I believe, a
scholar of Vannini, and a S. Andrew by him exists in the church of S.
Michele, in Berteldi, now commonly called S. Gaetano. Nor were these the
only artists capable of introducing figures into their perspective
pieces; but a great many of the painters in fresco were, if we may say
so, ambidexter, for each could paint perspectives and figures at the
same time.</p>

<p>Portrait painting, the school of the best artists who aspire to
fidelity of representation, was greatly promoted by Passignano, who
instructed Filippo Furini, surnamed Sciameroni, the father of the
celebrated Francesco. He also taught the art to Domenico and Valore
Casini, two brothers celebrated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329"
id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>by Baldinucci: Valore was remarkable
for a free pencil, and was a faithful copyist of every lineament. The
capital is filled with his portraits. Cristofano Allori painted
portraits, both on commission and for exercising his hand in the
delineation of the most beautiful forms. His portraits on canvass are
reckoned valuable, even when the subjects are not known: this is the
case with that in possession of the senator Orlandini; and some on small
pieces of copper, in the grand Medicean collection. Cerrini, among his
disciples, followed his steps; he is, I think, also admitted into that
museum. Giovanni Batista Stefaneschi, a monk of Monte Senario, a scholar
of Comodi, and an excellent miniature painter, was conspicuous among the
painters of portraits and copyists.</p>

<p>Justus Subtermans, a native of Antwerp, who was educated by William
de Vos, was also greatly admired. Having fixed his residence at
Florence, in the time of Cosmo II., he was retained by the court to the
end of the reign of Cosmo III.; and went to other princes in Germany and
Italy, who were ambitious of having a specimen of a portrait painter,
esteemed little inferior to Vandyck. He was much esteemed by the latter,
who requested his portrait, prefacing his request by sending him his
own. Peter Paul Rubens likewise honoured him, and presented him with one
of his own historical pictures, regarding him as an honour to their
country. Subtermans painted all the living members of the Medicean
family, in a variety of attitudes;<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> and when Ferdinand II.
ascended the throne, while still a young man, Subtermans executed a
stupendous picture, wholly composed of portraits. He represented in it
the ceremony of swearing allegiance to the new sovereign; and pourtrayed
him not only with his mother and grandmother, but the senators and
nobility who were present. This picture was very large: it has been
engraved on copper and still remains in the gallery. The artist had a
neatness and elegance of pencil that appeared extraordinary even in the
school to which he belonged; and possessed moreover a peculiar talent of
ennobling every countenance without injuring the likeness. It was his
practice to study the peculiar and characteristic air of the person, and
to impart it to his work; so that when he would sometimes conceal the
face of a portrait, the bystanders could with certainty tell whom it
represented, from the disposition of the hands and the figure.</p>

<p>Jacopo Borgognone remained long in Florence, and was highly respected
by Prince Matthias; whose military achievements in Germany and in Italy,
and the places where they happened, he represented to the life, as an
historian would have described them. This artist's battle-pieces are not
rare in Florence; but I do not know that he had any pupils in that
place. The person who promoted most the imitation of Jacopo, and whose
works are everywhere, was Pandolfo Reschi, of Danzig, who was one of his
best scholars; eminent <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331"
id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>in landscape in the style of Salvator
Rosa, and in architectural subjects. In the hands of Dr. Viligiardi, I
saw a picture by him, with a view of the Pitti palace, and the additions
to it then wanting; but which were afterwards supplied by the Austrian
princes, to the great ornament of the royal residence. Those additions
were from a design of Giacinta Marmi; but the whole picture was the work
of Pandolfo. He enlivened it with figures, and excites surprise by the
whole, excepting the distribution of the light and shadow, in which he
is not so happy. One Santi Rinaldi, surnamed Il Tromba,<a
name="fnanchor_224" id="fnanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224"
class="fnanchor">[224]</a> a painter of battle-pieces and of landscapes,
formed himself under Furini: he was contemporary with Pandolfo; but is
less known in Florence.</p>

<p>Baccio del Bianco, having become a good designer and tolerable
painter in the school of Bilivert, went into Germany with Pieroni, the
imperial architect and engineer, from whom he learnt perspective. He
afterwards taught it with applause in Florence, as we have said; and did
not omit to exercise his pencil, especially in fresco. Naturally
facetious, he became distinguished by his burlesques, which, for the
most part, were only designed with the pen. He coloured some small oil
pictures of much force, which were portraits in the style of the
Caracci, and sometimes painted freaks of scaramouches, and similar
abortions of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg
332]</a></span>Gio. Batista Brazze, called Il Bigio,<a
name="fnanchor_225" id="fnanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225"
class="fnanchor">[225]</a> a scholar of Empoli, employed his genius in
another branch of the capricious style: it consisted of what appeared
human figures when seen at a distance, but a nearer approach shewed them
to be composed of different sorts of fruit, or machines, artfully
arranged. Baldinucci reckons him the inventor of this art; but to me it
appears, that prior examples may be found in the Milanese school, in
which I treat of them fully at the end of the second epoch.</p>

<p>Lastly, mosaic work in hard stone owes its rise in Florence to this
epoch; and after gradually improving during two centuries, is now
everywhere known as a work of this capital, and almost exclusively its
own. In a letter of Teofilo Gallaccini,<a name="fnanchor_226"
id="fnanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
we read that this species of mosaic "had been invented in Florence, in
the time of Ferdinand I.;" an assertion which is not true. Before that
period it flourished in Lombardy. The Carthusian Monastery of Pavia had
in its pay a family of the name of Sacchi; which has existed there to
our own times, and has filled the great church with this kind of mosaic.
There are specimens of it in Milan of very ancient date. In that place
Giacomo da Trezzo, who executed the tabernacle for the church of the
Escurial, which is esteemed the most beautiful and magnificent in
Christendom,<a name="fnanchor_227" id="fnanchor_227"></a><a
href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> received <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>his
instruction. About the time of Cosmo I., Florence herself witnessed the
rudiments of this art in a "small picture composed of gems" which she
possessed, as is recorded by Vasari.<a name="fnanchor_228"
id="fnanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
A similar one was executed for Francis I., from a design of Vasari, by
Bernardino di Porfirio of Leccio, (a district of the Florentine state)
"composed of oriental alabaster, and large slabs of jasper, heliotrope,
cornelian, lapis lazzuli, agate, and other stones and gems, which they
estimate at 20,000 crowns." But pictures so wrought in large pieces,
were not of that perfect kind of mosaic that contained a vast variety of
colours and middle tints. Such are executed in every shade of colour,
from the natural stains of the stone itself; and the tints are lowered,
heightened, and managed, so as almost to rival painting. For this
purpose, every species of hard stone is collected and sawed; innumerable
colours are thence selected, graduating from the deepest to the lightest
shade, which are kept ready for use. This art was in request at Milan;
where, on account of the vicinity of Alpine countries abounding in every
species of hard stone, it arrived at great perfection. Francesco I.
meditating the erection of the magnificent chapel for the sepulture of
the royal family, in the church of S. Lorenzo, and the ornamenting it
with urns and altars wrought in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334"
id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>hard stone, invited Giovanni Bianchi
from that city to his court, in the year 1580, and committed the works
in mosaic to his direction. Soon after Ferdinando ascended the throne,
and the new art gained ground under him; it was promoted by Constantino
de' Servi, and afterwards by other artists, who progressively improved
it. The tables, cabinets, and coffers, small landscapes, and
architectural pieces which were there executed, and sent as presents to
princes, are dispersed over Europe. In one cabinet of the ducal gallery
there is an exquisite octagonal table, the round central piece of which
was designed by Poccetti, and the ornamental border by Ligozzi. Jacopo
Autelli executed the work, on which, with numerous assistants, he was
employed for sixteen years, and finished it in 1649. In the cabinet of
cameos and engraved gems, there are figures in <ins
title="'mezzorilievo' in the original">mezzo-relievo</ins>, and entire
little statues in hard stone, fabricated by the same company of artists;
not to mention what is in the Pitti palace and the church of S. Lorenzo.
A similar company still exists, under the direction of the Signori
Siries, and abounding in subordinate artists, which is supported with
royal magnificence by the prince, for whom it is constantly
employed.</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="Footnote_212" id="Footnote_212"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_212"><span class="label">[212]</span></a>
The new style began in the reign of Francesco I., who was greatly
skilled in design, which he had learnt of Buontalenti. He was succeeded
by Ferdinando I., Cosmo II., Ferdinando II., all of them celebrated for
their magnificent works in ornamenting the city and the palace:
Cardinals Gio. Carlo and Leopoldo de' Medici also flourished there, both
of them patrons of the arts; and the latter is recorded in history for
his knowledge of them, and the splendid collection which he formed. We
may add to these Prince Mattia, and others of that family.</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="Footnote_213" id="Footnote_213"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_213"><span class="label">[213]</span></a>
He was born in 1624, and died in 1692, leaving materials for the
completion of the work, which were afterwards arranged by Saverio, his
son, a gentleman of the law, who put the finishing hand to the whole.

<p class="footnote">
<a name="Footnote_214" id="Footnote_214"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_214"><span class="label">[214]</span></a>
In this branch of the art, indeed, he was not so greatly skilled; and
the Cav. Titi, after commending his Assumption, which is exhibited in
the entablature of the cathedral at Leghorn, adds, that not having been
conducted according to the rules of foreshortening, some exceptions may
be made to it.</p>

<p class="footnote">

<a href="#fnanchor_215"><span class="label">[215]</span></a>

the church of S. Anthony of Pisa, which he executed in a weak style in
1606.</p>

In the great saloon he has poetically represented the protection
afforded to literature by Lorenzo de' Medici. With some licences
peculiar to that age, and usual with him, the composition and the
figures are very beautiful; and there is an imitation of basso-relievo
in his painting, that would deceive the most skilful, and tempt them to
believe it absolutely raised from the wall. This work, left imperfect by
him, was completed by Pagani, by Montelatici, and by Furini, with some
semicircular pieces.</p>

Passeri, a great admirer of his tints, pronounces him a master of
invention; and, treating of his engravings, says, "such vigour of
conception, such novelty, and such variety, were never the gift of any
other artist. He is a poet in all his historic pieces, his composition
is full of fancy; this, however, is not equally commended by all, who
look for the simple action without other accessaries."</p>

<h4 class="p4">FLORENTINE SCHOOL.</h4>

<h4>EPOCH V.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Pietro da Cortona and his followers.</i></div>

<p class="p2">After the middle of the seventeenth century, the
Florentine school, and also that of Rome, underwent a remarkable
revolution, occasioned by the vast number of the followers of Pietro da
Cortona. Sects in painting have the same fate as sects in philosophy:
one succeeds another; and the new principles are propagated more or less
rapidly, according to the degree of opposition they have to encounter
where they happen to be diffused. The manner of Cortona met with
considerable opposition in Rome, as we shall find in the proper place.
He was invited to Florence by Ferdinand II. about the year 1640, to
ornament some of the apartments of the Pitti palace; and this work, in
which he spent several years, has appeared to connoisseurs the most
beautiful he ever performed. He was directed in this work by
Michelangiolo Bonarruoti the younger, a literary man of great judgment;
and Cortona appears also to display learning in the execution. In one
apartment he painted the four ages of the world, which the poets of all
nations have described in imitation of Hesiod; five other chambers were
dedicated to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg
336]</a></span>five fabulous deities, from whom they were named the
chamber of Minerva, of Apollo, of Mars, of Jupiter, and of Mercury. He
united the mythology of each with history. Thus, for instance, in the
chamber of Apollo, he represents this patron of the fine arts on the
ceiling in the act of receiving the young Hercules, who is introduced by
Minerva, that he may be instructed; and on the walls he painted
Alexander reading the works of Homer, Augustus listening to Virgil, and
other similar stories, which are fully described by Passeri in his Life
of Cortona. The great work was finished by Ciro Ferri; for after Cortona
had begun the chamber of Mercury, on some disgust, which is variously
related, he secretly withdrew from court, returned to Rome, and always
declined when repeatedly invited to revisit Florence. There, however, he
had laid the foundations of a new school. Baldinucci remarks on the
style of Pietro, that it was no sooner seen at Florence, than praised by
the best judges.<a name="fnanchor_229" id="fnanchor_229"></a><a
href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The predilection of
Cosmo III. contributed to bring it into credit; this prince pensioned
Ciro Ferri in Rome, that he might instruct the Tuscans who came there to
study. At that time there was no artist of that country who did not,
more or less, imitate this style. We shall now describe it, and trace it
to its origin.</p>

<p>Pietro Berrettini, a native of Cortona, the scholar of Comodi in
Tuscany, and of Ciarpi at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337"
id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>Rome, is mentioned also among the
writers on the art.<a name="fnanchor_230" id="fnanchor_230"></a><a
href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> He acquired his
knowledge of design by copying antique <ins title="one word in the
original">basso-relievos</ins>, and the chiaroscuros of Polidoro, a man
who appears inspired by the soul of an ancient. Pietro chose Trajan's
column as his favourite study; and from it he may have drawn his heavy
proportions, and the appearance of strength and robustness, that
characterize even his female forms and his children: in their eyes,
noses, and lips, he surpasses the medium standard; and their hands and
feet are certainly not remarkable for their light elegance. But in
contrast, or the art of opposing group to group, figure to figure, and
part to part, in which he was distinguished, he appears to have followed
Lanfranco, and partly to have formed it from the Bacchanalian vases,
which are particularly mentioned in his life by Passeri. His taste may
probably have been drawn, in some measure, from the Venetian school;
since having gone to study there, and then returned to Rome, he
destroyed what he had previously done, and executed his works anew in
the Barberini palace, according to the account of Boschini, his great
admirer. Generally speaking, he finishes nothing highly but what was
intended to be most conspicuous; he <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>avoids strong shadows,
is fond of middle tints, prefers the less brilliant grounds, colours
without affectation, and is reckoned the inventor and chief artist of a
style, which, in the opinion of Mengs, combines facility with taste. He
employed it in pictures of all sizes with applause; but in painting of
furniture, and still more on ceilings, in cupolas, and recesses, he
carried it to a pitch of beauty which will never fail to procure him
panegyrists and imitators. The judicious division of his historical
compositions, which derives aid from the architecture, that skilful
gradation by which he represents the immensity of aerial space beyond
the clouds, his knowledge in the art of foreshortening what is seen from
below, that play of light seemingly celestial, that symmetrical
disposition of his figures, are circumstances which enchant the eye and
fascinate the soul.</p>

<p>It is true that this manner does not always satisfy the mind; for
intent on gratifying the eye, it introduces useless figures, in order
that the composition may not be deficient in the usual fulness; and for
the sake of contrast, figures in the performance of the gentlest
actions, are painted as if the artist was representing them in a
tournament or a battle. Gifted by nature with facility of genius, and no
less judgment, Berrettini either avoided this extravagance, as in his
stupendous Conversion of S. Paul, or did not carry it to that absurdity,
which in our times has marked his followers, from the usual tendency of
all schools to overcharge the characteristic <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>of their master. Hence
the facility of this style has degenerated into negligence and its taste
into affectation; until its chief adherents begin as at present to
abandon it, and to adopt a superior manner.</p>

<p>But not to wander from the Florentine school, we must confess that
this epoch has been the least productive of eminent painters. Pietro had
some pupils at that place, who did him equal honour with the Romanelli
and the Ferri at Rome. I shall first mention a foreigner, who having
established himself at Florence, may be reckoned of that school. Livio
Mehus, a native of Flanders, came into Tuscany from Milan, where he had
received some instruction in the art from another Fleming, named
Charles, was taken under the protection of Prince Matthias, and
recommended to Berrettini, who gave him lessons for a little time both
in Florence and at Rome. By copying the antique he became a good
designer, and he studied colouring at Venice and in Lombardy. He
retained little of the manner of Cortona besides the composition. He
imitated the Venetians less in colouring, than in the light and firm
touches of his pencil. His tints are modest, his attitudes lively, his
shadows most beautiful, and his inventions ingenious. He painted few
altar pieces, but many cabinet pictures, for he was pensioned by the
prince, and employed by noble families, in whose houses his works are
often to be met with. The historical picture of the Repose of Bacchus
and Ariadne, which he painted for Marquis Gerini, in emulation of Ciro
Ferri, is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg
340]</a></span>very highly praised. Ferri conceived some jealousy of
him, when he painted the cupola of the Pace at Florence; where he
appears to approach the Lombard school, and even to surpass Cortona.<a
name="fnanchor_231" id="fnanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231"
class="fnanchor">[231]</a> He was imitated by a Lorenzo Rossi,
previously a scholar of Pier Dandini, who, according to P. Orlandi,
executed some elegant small pictures.</p>

<p>Vincenzio Dandini went from the school of his brother Cesare into
that of Cortona, or rather into the Roman school, where he copied, as
well as he could, with unwearied assiduity, the finest specimens in
painting, sculpture, and architecture. On this foundation, aided by
practice in anatomy, at the academy for the naked figure, which still
flourished at Florence, he became superior to his brother in design and
in softness of colouring: he also finished more highly than Cesare, was
more studious in his drapery, and in the other branches of the art. In
All Saints there is a Conception of the Virgin, and three other pictures
by his hand. He was employed in the ducal villas: in that of Poggio
Imperiale he painted a beautifully foreshortened figure of Aurora,
attended by the Hours, in a recess he had erected; and at Petraia
painted in oil the Sacrifice of Niobe. In him the pupil of Cortona is
very manifest. A similar style, but degenerated both in execution and in
manner, is discoverable in Pietro, his son and scholar. This artist was
superior to all the other Dandini; and by more extensive travels he
obtained a greater knowledge of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341"
id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>foreign painters: it would have been
well if he had not attempted to surpass them also in his emoluments.
From avarice he undertook too many works, and contented himself with a
certain mediocrity in study; for which he, in some measure compensated
by a freedom of pencil that is always admirable. Where well paid, he
demonstrated his abilities; as in the cupola of S. Mary Magdalen; in
several frescos in the ducal palace at Florence, in the royal villas,
and in the copious historical picture of the taking of Jerusalem, which
he painted in the public palace at Pisa. He also painted some
altar-pieces worthy of himself; as the S. Francis in S. Maria Maggiore
or the Beato Piccolomini in the attitude of saying mass, in possession
of the Servi; a beautiful picture, full of spirited attitudes. His son,
Ottaviano, appears his follower in some semicircular pictures in the
cloister of S. Spirito, in a piece representing various saints in the
church of S. Lorenzo; and wherever he was employed. One of his grandest
works may be seen in S. Mary Magdalen at Pescia, the ceiling of which he
painted in fresco.</p>

<p>The Dandini family had many scholars, who, with their descendants,
have kept alive the school of Cortona, even to our own days. This school
was not eminent; it requires but little examination, or prolixity of
description. It has produced some good artists; but few of them are
above mediocrity; a fault less to be attributed to their genius, than
the times. The more modern style was <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>esteemed the best: the
last master seemed to discover new maxims in painting, and abolished the
old: and thus artists of little celebrity gave birth to others more
minute and mannered, resembling their prototype in maxims, but inferior
in reputation. About this time it became fashionable to paint with a
certain degree of careless ease, or <i>Sprezzatura</i>, as it is styled
by some; and Giordano and some Venetians are applauded for this manner.
Several Florentine artists tried to imitate them, and have produced
works that resemble sketches: this species of mannerism is not uncommon
in other schools. It is unnecessary to be particular, but only to
observe generally that such artists are as rare in choice collections of
pictures, as Andrea del Sarto or Cigoli: the latter are there scarce,
because they painted with great care; the former class because they
painted with very little. In the work entitled <i>Series of the most
celebrated painters</i>, we find Antonio Riccianti, Michele Noferi, and
some others whose names are merely mentioned as scholars of Vincenzio;
and Gabbiani is the only one particularly praised. In like manner, among
the pupils of Pietro Dandini we find the names of Gio. Cinqui, whose
portrait is in the ducal gallery, Antonio Puglieschi, of Florence, who
studied under Ciro, and Valerio Baldassari of Pescia; but there is a
particular eulogy bestowed on Fratinelli, whom we shall notice
hereafter. I find also that P. Alberigo Carlini, a Minorite monk of
Pescia, was the pupil of Ottaviano, and attended Conca at Rome. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>He
painted some good pictures, chiefly in the church of his order at
Pietrasanta. To his we may also add the name of Santarelli, a patrician
of the same country, and who died at Rome.</p>

<p>The most celebrated pupil of the Dandini was Anton Domenico Gabbiani,
not long ago mentioned; before he was the pupil of Vincenzio, he had
lessons from Subtermans, and finished his education at Rome under Ciro
Ferri, and at Venice by studying the best masters. We must not give
credit to Pascoli, who has represented him as a mean artist.<a
name="fnanchor_232" id="fnanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232"
class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Gabbiani ranks amongst the best designers of
his age; a collection of his drawings is in the possession of Sig.
Pacini, which was often inspected and commended by Mengs for the
facility and elegance he there discovered. Many of his designs were
engraved and published in his life by Ignatius Hugford. His colouring
sometimes borders on the languid, but is generally good: he is correct
and natural, especially in fleshy tints; juicy, and tempered by a
pleasing harmony. The greatest fault in the style of this artist is in
his draperies, which, though correct, and studied with his usual
diligence, always exhibit a degree of heaviness in the execution, are
too confined, and sometimes are not quite true in the colouring. His
merit is very great in light subjects: in the Pitti, and other palaces
of some of the nobility of Florence, his dances of genii and <ins
title="'groupes' in the original.">groups</ins> of boys are to be met
with, and yield little <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344"
id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>to those of Baciccio. One of the finest
is in the house of the Orlandini family; and the Marquis of Riccardi has
specimens among the mirrors placed in his collection. His largest and
most celebrated work in fresco is the vast cupola of Cestello, which he
did not wholly finish. His oil pictures are esteemed precious even in
the ducal gallery. Several of his works of unequal merit are preserved
in churches; but his S. Philip, in possession of the fathers Dell'
Oratorio, justifies the assertion of Redi, that, except Maratta, there
was then no painter in Rome that could eclipse him.<a
name="fnanchor_233" id="fnanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233"
class="fnanchor">[233]</a> The catalogue of his scholars is extensive;
but some of them, as happens to every master, may be also claimed by
other preceptors. Benedetto Luti was an honour to Gabbiani and to
Florence. Having formed himself in this school, he went to Rome, in
hopes of receiving the instructions of Ciro Ferri; but the death of that
master intervening, he was guided by his own genius, and the monuments
of art existing in that city. The style he there formed may be
considered a compound of various imitations, select in the forms,
pleasing and bright in colouring, shewing art in the distribution of
light and shade, and as harmonious to the eye as is the orator to the
ear, who enchants an audience by his well turned periods; the delightful
fascination is felt, but the source of it cannot be assigned. In that
metropolis we shall find him master of the new style; but in Tuscany we
cannot point out many <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345"
id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>of his pictures besides those in the
ducal palace: private collections are rich only in his crayon pieces,
which are likewise well known out of Italy. There is one of his large
pictures on canvass at Pisa, the subject of which is the Vestment of S.
Ranieri; and it is the most admired among the larger paintings of the
cathedral. Luti sent it to Gabbiani for his correction before it was
exposed to the public; a circumstance highly honourable to the modesty
of the scholar and the abilities of the master.<a name="fnanchor_234"
id="fnanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
His portrait is in the ducal gallery; and the more rigid critics, on
looking at it, have been known to say, "Behold the last painter of his
school."</p>

<p>Tommaso Redi was a pupil of the same master; and is noticed in the
<i>Lettere Pittoriche</i>, as a good composer of historical pictures,
and is also praised for design, colouring, and spirit. From the school
of Gabbiani he went under the tuition of Maratta and Balestra, both
artists respectable for their style, and declared enemies to the
innovations which have occupied and debased our schools for so long a
period. Redi also visited the most celebrated schools, but for the sole
purpose of studying the old masters, and of making copies of their
works, some of which, with a few pieces of his own invention, remain in
his family. In the eulogy of Anton Domenico we find honourable mention
made of his nephew, Gaetano Gabbiani; of Francesco Salvetti, his
intimate friend; of Gio. Antonio Pucci, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>a painter and a poet;
of Giuseppe Baldini, whose promising career was cut short by death, and
of Ranieri del Pace, a native of Pisa, who afterwards yielding to the
torrent of fashion, became a complete mannerist. Ignatius Hugford, born
in Florence, but whose father was a native of England,<a
name="fnanchor_235" id="fnanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235"
class="fnanchor">[235]</a> was admirably skilled in recognizing the
hands of different masters, and likewise painted in a good manner a
picture of S. Raphael at S. Felicità, and some other pieces, which were
mostly small, and have been admitted into the royal museum. The<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
feeble paintings in possession of the Vallombrosani at Forli, and some
of the same stamp at Florence, are likewise by this artist.</p>

<p>Alessandro Gherardini, a rival of Gabbiani, and in the opinion of
many, his superior in genius as a painter, had wonderful facility in
counterfeiting different styles. He would have equalled any of his
contemporaries, had he always painted in the style of his Crucifixion of
our Lord in Candeli, in which he calls to mind a happy imitation of
different schools. It is a work studied in every part, especially in the
general tone, which artfully expresses the darkness of that hour. A
history piece of Alexander the Great, in Casa Orlandini, with figures of
half-length, and executed with great industry, is also held in high
esteem; but he aimed at painting pictures of every degree of merit. One
of his pupils, no less fertile in talent, and named Sebastiano Galeotti,
is rather remembered than known at Florence. He left his native place
when young, travelled about a long time without any fixed residence, and
has left specimens behind him in many parts of Upper Italy. He at length
settled at Genoa, where we shall again notice him. The ducal gallery
contains portraits both of the master and of the scholar, by the side of
those of Gabbiani and Redi. Other considerable painters of this epoch
have obtained a similar honour; among whom we may mention Agostino
Veracini, a scholar of Sebastian Ricci, Francesco Conti, a disciple of
Maratta, and Lapi, a follower of Giordano; <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>each of these has
successfully imitated his guide.<a name="fnanchor_236"
id="fnanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
The S. Apollonia of the first, painted for the church of that name;
various Madonnas of the second, in the hands of private gentlemen; and
the Transfiguration of the last, in the ducal gallery, are calculated to
do them honour, and even to shed a lustre on some of their less refined
productions. Some others now dead have been equally honoured by a
portrait, of whom I have not discovered any other work. Of this number
are Vincenzio Bacherelli, Gio. Francesco Bagnoli, Anton Sebastiano
Bettini, Gio. Casini, Niccolo Nannetti, and others, who are mentioned in
the <i>Museo Fiorentino</i>.</p>

<p>Giovanni Camillo Sagrestani, a scholar of Giusti, was esteemed at
Florence, even during the lifetime of Gabbiani and Gherardini. To study
different masters, he visited the best schools of Italy, and for some
time attended the school of Cav. Cignani, whose manner he copied rather
than emulated. One of his Holy Families is in the Madonna de' Ricci, the
beauty of which has more of an ideal cast, and the colouring is more
florid, than is usual with his contemporaries of this school. One of the
first judges in Florence assured me that this painting was the work of
Sagrestani, although others ascribe it to his scholar, Matteo Bonechi.
Bonechi had excellent parts, but not an equal knowledge of the art, in
which he is reported to have been instructed <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>by a species of
dictation; for he practised under the eye, and was directed by the voice
of his master. He thus became one of those practical artists who make up
for the poverty of their design by their spirit and their colouring.
There are some of his pictures that in any collection would be
particularly calculated to attract the eye. Among his works in fresco,
the picture at Cestello, where he finished what was begun by Gabbiani,
is worthy of record; and also that in the Capponi palace near the
Nunziata, where he continued the work of Marinari.</p>

<p>About this time Cignani died in Bologna, and Gio. Gioseffo del Sole,
denominated the modern Guido, enjoyed the highest reputation. Florence
employed three of his eminent pupils; one of the two Soderini, Meucci,
and Ferretti, who although called da Imola, was born and lived in
Florence. Mauro Soderini enjoyed the reputation of a good designer, and
aimed at beauty and effect in his pictures. The Death of S. Joseph in
the cathedral is said to be by his hand, though it is in fact by
Ferretti; the Child revived by S. Zanobi, in the church of S. Stephen,
is really his. Vincenzio Meucci was chiefly employed in works of
perspective, which he executed in many parts of Tuscany, and even in the
cupola of the royal chapel in S. Lorenzo. If there was any one who could
dispute with him pre-eminence in fresco painting, it was his fellow
disciple, Giovanni Domenico Ferretti, whose works may be seen in
Florence, in several other parts of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>Tuscany, and at
Bologna; from which he appears to have surpassed Meucci in fancy and in
spirit, and especially at the Philippini at Pistoia, where his
performance in the cupola is highly praised. In fresco works they were
both excellent; but in oil paintings they often were too hasty, an error
into which all fresco painters, not excepting the most esteemed, have
fallen. Hence Ferretti, although he painted the Martyrdom of S.
Bartolommeo, for the church dedicated to that saint at Pisa, in an
excellent style, did not give equal satisfaction by his History of S.
Guido, in the archiepiscopal church. Several of the works of Meucci are
dispersed through the various churches in Florence; and in a chapel of
the Nunziata, where he painted the recess, he coloured a Madonna, which
is allowed to be one of his most diligent and best finished pictures. He
was there rivalled by Giuseppe Grisoni, a scholar of Redi; and it is
reported that vexation at this circumstance shortened his days. Grisoni
had travelled more than he in visiting the schools of Italy, had even
gone to England, and had acquired great skill in figures, and still more
in landscape. He therefore was induced to add landscape not only to
historical, but also to portrait painting; as in the instance of a
portrait of himself that is one of the most respectable in the second
chamber of painters. He added it also to the S. Barbara, painted in
competition with Meucci; and it is a picture which does honour to the
school in form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351"
id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span> relief, and taste of colouring. He
likewise painted other pieces on the same plan, in which, however, he
did not succeed so well.</p>

<p>Meucci and Grisoni cannot be reckoned Italian artists of the same
rank with Luti; but if all are to be estimated by the times in which
they flourished, each was eminent in his day. I had noticed them briefly
in my first edition, and some painters have informed me, that with them
I ought to have mentioned Giuseppe Zocchi, who was a painter of note,
and should not have been omitted even in a compendium of the history of
the art. I now correct my error, and produce what information the noble
family of Gerini, under whose protection he was received when a boy, and
who, after his elementary studies at Florence, sent him to Rome, to
Bologna, and other parts of Lombardy, for his instruction in the
different schools, have supplied me. I may be allowed to add, that the
Florentine nobility have always been most liberal in this way; and there
are not a few living artists who owe their education in the fine arts to
the bounty of some noble family: such clients are an ornament to a
nobleman, and are not to be numbered among his servants. Zocchi had a
genius fertile in invention, pliant in imitation, and judicious in
selection; and hence at the conclusion of such a course of study, he was
able to compose large works with skill, and to colour beautifully. He
painted four pretty large frescos in the villa Serristori, beyond the
gate of S. Nicholas, some <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352"
id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>apartments in the Rinuccini palace, and
one in the Gerini gallery; and these are believed to be his best works
of this sort. In smaller pieces he was still greater; as in his oil
picture of the festivities at Siena, on the arrival of the Emperor
Francis I., a work very true in the perspective, and graceful in the
multitude of figures which he there inserted. It is deposited in the
splendid Sansedonii collection of pictures at Siena, where the
entertainment given to the Grand Duke Peter Leopold may also be seen:
with this object in view the painter went to Siena, where he caught the
epidemic disorder that raged there in 1767, and soon after died at
Florence.</p>

<p>On turning to the other parts of Tuscany, we find them from the
beginning of the eighteenth century full of the followers of Cortona;
San Sepolcro boasted one Zei, of whom I find no further account than
that of his painting an altar-piece representing the souls in purgatory,
for the cathedral of that place, a work extremely well coloured, and
conducted in the maxims of the school, though the countenances are of a
common cast; and if we except the liberating angel, of poor expression.
Among this sect we cannot include Gio. Batista Mercati, one of the
latest painters of that city, not unknown at Rome, and much noted in his
native place, where he painted either at a more mature time of life, or
with greater pains. Two of his historical frescos, representing our
Lady, are in S. Chiara; and at S. Lorenzo there is a picture of the
titular with other saints; in both there is <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>an air apparently drawn
from the school of the Caracci, especially in the breadth of the
drapery, which is well cast, and skilfully varied. In the Guides to
Venice and to Rome, several of his works are mentioned, and in that of
Leghorn, the only picture in the cathedral esteemed worthy of notice is
that of the Five Saints, painted by Mercati with great care. Orlandi
notices Tommaso Lancisi, a scholar of Scaminossi, and two of his
brothers, and adds, that painting was an hereditary honour in this
family.</p>

<p>One only of the countrymen of Berrettini is known to me as his
follower; his name is Adriano Palladino; he is mentioned by Orlandi,
which is the only trace of him that I have discovered; I never saw any
of his works, nor heard them mentioned by any one.</p>

<p>Arezzo abounds with pictures in the manner of Cortona. Salvi
Castellucci, the scholar of Pietro, either at Florence or at Rome, was a
great imitator of his style, and painted with expedition, according to
the practice of the school. He executed many good pieces in the
cathedral, and other churches, besides numerous cabinet pictures that
are in private houses, which are estimable for the facility and good
taste of their colouring. One of his frescos, representing our Lady
surrounded by the patron saints of the city, is in the public palace;
but he is greater in oil painting. He had a son, on whom he bestowed the
name of Pietro, probably <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354"
id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>in honour of his master. He also was a
follower of Cortona, but never equalled his father.</p>

<p>Pistoia, however, had two Gimignani, the father Giacinto, and
Lodovico, his son, of whom it is still disputed which was the most
eminent. From the school of Poussin, Giacinto entered that of
Berrettini; and as he approached nearer his first master in design and
composition, so in colouring and in taste for architecture he came
nearest to the second. He moreover took the lead in works of fresco.
Here he rivalled Camassei and Maratta, at the baptistery of S. Gio.
Laterano, where he painted the histories of Constantine, besides leaving
other specimens in different parts of Rome, in the Niccolini palace at
Florence, and other places. In some pictures he also emulated Guercino,
as for instance in the Leander in the ducal gallery, which was long
considered as a Guercino. Though Lodovico was the scholar of Giacinto,
he is not so correct in design, but was superior to his father in all
the faculties that excite pleasing emotions; his ideas are more
beautiful, his tints more lovely, his attitudes more spirited, and his
harmony more agreeable. It would appear either that the style of his
maternal uncle Orbetto, had attracted his attention, or that Bernini,
the director of his studies, had led him into this path. He obtained
great applause for his works in fresco, and those he executed at Rome in
the church of the Virgins are studied by artists for the attitudes, the
clouds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg
355]</a></span> and the grace of the wings with which his angels were
furnished. He chiefly resided at Rome, which possesses several of his
paintings for churches, and a far greater number for halls and private
rooms; being moreover much employed in these for foreign countries. Two
histories of S. John by the hand of Giacinto, are in the church
dedicated to that saint at Pistoia; and there was also a S. Rocco in the
cathedral, which was esteemed excellent. Lodovico executed a beautiful
picture for the church of the Capuchins, now converted into a parish
church.</p>

<p>After the death of both, Lazzaro Baldi still remained, another great
ornament of the school of Cortona, and of Pistoia, his native place. He
may be there recognised in two pictures, the Annunciation in the church
of S. Francis, and the Repose in Egypt in that of the Madonna della
Umiltà. This latter place is a most majestic octagonal temple, executed
by Ventura Vitoni of Pistoia, the great pupil of Bramante, and
surmounted by a cupola, which is reckoned among the noblest in Italy.
Baldi finally established his abode in Rome; where he was much employed,
as well as in other parts of the states of the Church. One of the most
studied pictures he ever painted is at S. Camerino, and represents S.
Peter receiving the pontifical power. A still more recent artist is Gio.
Domenico Piastrini, a scholar of Luti, who in the porch of Madonna della
Umiltà, filled two large spaces with pictures, illustrative of the
history of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356"
id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span> church, and who rivalled the best
followers of Maratta, in S. Maria in Via Lata, at Rome. It is not
foreign to this period to notice Gio. Batista Cipriani, who was born in
Florence, but descended from a family of Pistoia;<a name="fnanchor_237"
id="fnanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
especially as he left specimens of his pencil in the neighbourhood of
the places we have just mentioned. Two of his altar-pieces were in the
abbey of S. Michael-on-the-Sea; one of S. Thesaurus, the other of S.
Gregory VII. which are valuable, as Cipriani painted but little. His
excellence lay in design, which he acquired from the collection of the
studies of Gabbiani, before<ins title="hyphenated in the original">
</ins>mentioned. Having afterwards gone to London, he was much employed
by the celebrated Bartolozzi, who has immortalized the painter by
engraving his inventions. We might augment our catalogue with the two
Giusti and Michele Paoli, a Pistoian of the school of Crespi; but they
did not attain maturity, if we depend on the information afforded by the
continuator of <i>Felsina Pittrice</i>.<a name="fnanchor_238"
id="fnanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238"
class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg
357]</a></span>Of those within the Florentine territory, the Pisans, and
of those beyond it, the artists of Lucca, yet remain to be considered.
Camillo Gabrieli, a scholar of Ciro, was the first who transplanted the
style of Cortona into Pisa; and in this manner executed a good oil
painting at the convent of the Carmelites, and also several for private
individuals; in this kind of painting he was more happy than in fresco.
In this line, however, his memory is honoured in his native place, both
for his works in the grand saloon of the Alliata palace, and in the
apartments of other noblemen's houses; and likewise on account of his
pupils, the two Melani, who have contributed much to his reputation. We
shall notice Francesco among the professors of architectural design:
Giuseppe his brother, and a knight of the golden spur, became no common
artist in figures, and was worthy of painting in the cathedral a large
oil picture of the death of S. Ranieri. Although this piece ranks in the
scale of mediocrity in this sanctuary of the arts, it does honour to its
author; the invention is good, the perspective is regular, and exhibits
no marks of carelessness, as is so often the case. But his place is
among the painters in fresco; in which department he ornamented with
figures the architectural works of his brother; and has shewn himself
tenacious of the manner of Cortona, both in what is commendable in it,
as the perspective, colouring, and harmony; and also where it is less
praiseworthy, as in the heaviness and imperfect finish of the
figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg
358]</a></span>With a similar instance we shall commence the series of
artists of Lucca: the two brothers, Ippolito and Giovanni Marracci,
obtained equal applause in very different branches of the art; the
former was a painter of architecture, the latter of figures; and of him
only we shall here speak. Although little known beyond Lucca, he is
reckoned among the eminent scholars and most successful imitators of
Pietro da Cortona; and merits this name, either when he painted in
fresco, as in the cupola of S. Ignatius, at S. Giovanni; or when he
wrought in oil, as he did in several pictures in the possession of the
brotherhood of S. Lorenzo, in the collegiate church of S. Michael, and
in other places. With equal success two other artists, natives of Lucca,
who had been educated in his school, became imitators, for a period, of
Pier Cortona. These were Giovanni Coli and Filippo Gherardi, who were
trained in the school of their native place, and resembled each other no
less in style than in disposition; so that though they usually painted
in the same piece, all their joint labours appear the work of a single
artist. They afterwards adopted a manner that participates of the
Venetian and Lombard schools; and in this style they painted the vast
ceiling of the library of S. Giorgio Maggiore at Venice. Rome possesses
some of their stupendous works in the church of the Lucchesi, and in the
magnificent Colonna gallery. The most celebrated picture with which they
ornamented their native place was the fresco <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>of the tribune of the
church of S. Martin, and next to it that in S. Matthew's, which they
decorated with three oil pictures. After the death of Coli, his
companion resided and continued to paint in Lucca: the whole cloister of
the Carmelite monastery was painted by him alone.</p>

<p>The manner of Cortona was likewise adhered to by Gio. Batista
Brugieri, a scholar of Baldi and of Maratta, who was in his day highly
applauded for his works in the chapel of the Sacrament, at the Servi,
and his other productions in public. P. Stefano Cassiani, from the
fraternity to which he belonged, surnamed Il Certosino, or the
Carthusian, painted in fresco the cupola of his church, and two large
histories of our Lady, besides other reputable works in the style of
Cortona, at the Certosa of Pisa, of Siena, and elsewhere. Girolamo
Scaglia, a disciple of Paulini and of Gio. Marracci, is surnamed
Parmegianino. In architecture he imitated Berrettini, as is remarked by
Sig. da Morrona;<a name="fnanchor_239" id="fnanchor_239"></a><a
href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> in his shadows he
followed Paulini, and sometimes approached Ricchi: as a painter his
effect was superior to his design; or as it was observed by the Cav.
Titi, (p. 146) on beholding his picture of the Presentation, painted at
Pisa, it exhibits extreme industry and very little taste. Gio. Domenico
Campiglia was reckoned among the best designers in Rome; and of him the
engravers of antiquities particularly availed themselves. He was not
without merit as a painter; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360"
id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>and in Florence, where he executed some
pictures, his portrait has a place among those of eminent artists. A
picture painted by Pietro Sigismondi, of Lucca, for the great altar of
S. Nicholas in Arcione at Rome, is honourably mentioned by Titi: I know
not whether any of his works remain in his native place; and the same is
the case with Massei and with Pini, who will be considered in another
school.</p>

<p>I shall close this series with two other artists; and had the age
produced many like them, Italian painting would not have declined so
much as it has done during the eighteenth century. Giovanni Domenico
Lombardi lived not, like his pupil, Cav. Batoni, within the enlightening
precincts of Rome, but in merit he was at least equal to Batoni. He
formed his style on the works of Paulini, and improved it by studying
the finest colourists at Venice, and also by paying attention to the
school of Bologna. The genius of this artist, his taste, his grand and
resolute tone, appear in several of his pictures, executed in his best
time, and with real pains. Such are his two pieces on the sides of the
choir of the Olivetani, which represent their founder, S. Bernard,
administering relief to the citizens infected with the plague. There are
two others in a chapel of S. Romano, which are painted with a magic
force approaching to the best manner of Guercino; and one of them, in
the opinion of the most rigid critics, seems the work of that artist
himself. He should always have painted thus; <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>and never have
prostituted his pencil to manufacture pieces at all prices. Batoni, who
will be noticed in our third book among the Roman masters, supported
better his own dignity and that of the art. He adhered in a great
measure to the maxims of this school, a circumstance which did not
altogether please his first master, who on examining some of his early
performances, remarked, that they required a greater covering of dirt,
for they appear to him too trimly neat. One who has not an opportunity
of examining his capital works, may satisfy himself in Lucca, either in
the church of the Olivetine fathers, where he painted the Martyrdom of
S. Bartolommeo; or in that of S. Catharine of Siena, where she is
represented receiving the mystic wounds of the crucifixion.</p>

<p>I shall not here mention many artists in the inferior walks of the
art. The example of Cortona influenced none in this class, except a few
ornamental painters, and some artists who accompanied their figures by
landscapes. The painters of landscapes, flowers, and the like, continued
to follow their original models. Chiavistelli, for instance, has been
followed by various artists in fresco of this age, who besides executing
figures, have exercised, as before remarked, other branches of painting.
Pure architectural and ornamental painting in a good taste are, however,
distinct arts; and to attain excellence in them requires all the
faculties of man. Angiol Rossi, of Florence, applied himself to it, as I
believe, in Bologna; and assiduously <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>practised it at Venice,
as we are informed by Guarienti. Two artists of Lucca, Pietro Scorzini
and Bartolommeo Santi, received their education at Bologna, and were the
favourite decorators of many theatres. Francesco Melani, of Pisa,
adhered strongly to Cortona. As learned in perspective as his brother
was in figures, his style was so similar, that no architectural painter
was so well suited to accompany the figures of the other. This will be
allowed by all who view the ceiling in the church of S. Matthew at Pisa,
which is their finest work, or their paintings in Siena, and at other
places, where they were employed together. They educated a pupil worthy
of them, in Tommaso Tommasi, of Pietra Santa, a man of vast conception,
who succeeded in Pisa to the commissions bestowed upon his masters, and
produced very pleasing specimens of his powers in the nave of the church
of S. Giovanni. Ippolito Marracci, of Lucca, the scholar of Metelli,
appears a successful rival of his master, either when he painted by
himself, as in the Rotonda, at Lucca, or when associated with his
brother, as was generally the case. Domenico Schianteschi, a disciple of
Bibieni, lived in San Sepolcro; his perspectives in that city are to be
seen in the houses of many of the nobility, and are much esteemed.</p>

<p>Florence has boasted professed portrait painters, even to the present
time; among whom Gaetano Piattoli is particularly extolled. He was pupil
to a French artist, Francesco Riviera, who had resided <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>and
died at Leghorn, and was very much prized in collections for the
excellence of his Conversazioni and Turkish ballets. He is well known
too, in other countries; for he was employed to take portraits of the
foreign nobility who visited Florence. The portrait of himself, which he
painted for the ducal gallery, indicates the style of the rest. An
illustrious female artist emanated from the school of Gabbiani, although
assisted in her studies by other masters, and this was Giovanna
Fratellini, who was not without invention, and was most expert in
portrait painting. She executed in oil, in crayons, in miniature, and in
enamel, various portraits of the family of Cosmo III. and of other
princes, to paint whom she was sent by her sovereign to several cities
of Italy. That which she painted of herself, is in the ducal gallery: in
it she has blended the employment of the artist with the affection of a
mother. She is represented in the act of taking a likeness of Lorenzo,
her only son and pupil, who died in the flower of his age. It is painted
in crayons, an art in which she may be called the Rosalba of her time.
Domenico Tempesti, or Tempestino, is rather included among engravers
than painters; though he was instructed by Volterrano in Florence, in
the latter art, and exercised it with credit both in landscape and
portrait. He is mentioned by Vianelli in the catalogue of his pictures.
It would appear that he was the same Domenico de Marchis, called
Tempestino, whom Orlandi casually notices <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>in the article of
Girolamo Odam, whom Domenico had initiated in the elements of landscape
painting. Orlandi gives also a separate article, under the head of
Domenico Tempesti, in which his voyages through Europe, and his long
residence at Rome, are dwelt upon.</p>

<p>Many landscapes, chiefly rural views, painted by Paolo Anesi, are
dispersed through Florence, and there are also many of them in Rome.
Francesco Zuccherelli, a native of Pitigliano, born in the year 1702,
was his scholar. On going to Rome, he resided there a long time, and
first entered the school of Morandi, and afterwards of Pietro Nelli. His
first intention was to study figures, but by one of those circumstances
which discover the natural predilection, he applied himself to painting
landscape; and pursued it in a manner that united strength and
sweetness; and has been highly extolled not only in Italy, but over all
Europe. His figures also were elegant, and these he was sometimes
employed to introduce in the landscapes and architectural pieces of
other artists. His principal field in Italy was Venice, where he was
settled, until the celebrated Smith made him known in England, and
invited him to that island, in which he remained many years, exercising
his pencil for the court, and for the most considerable collections of
pictures. He enjoyed the particular esteem of Count Algarotti; in the
possession of whose heirs are two landscapes by Tesi, with figures by
Zuccherelli: of the first artist I shall <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>again speak in the
school of Bologna. Algarotti was commissioned by the court of Dresden to
procure the works of the best modern painters, and suggested to
Zuccherelli subjects for two pictures, in which he succeeded admirably,
and was employed to repeat them for the king of Prussia. In his old age
he returned to Rome, and was employed there, at Venice and in Florence,
where he died in 1788. These anecdotes of Zuccherelli I obtained along
with many others from the Sig. Avvocato Lessi, a gentleman deeply versed
in the fine arts.</p>

<p>The name of this artist brings to a fair conclusion the series of
Florentine painters, which has been continued for little less than six
centuries, in an uninterrupted succession of native artists, without the
intervention of one foreign master in this school, at least one so
eminent as to mark an era. With the exception of the last years, in
which art was on the decline throughout Italy, the Florentine school,
with all its merit, and that is undoubtedly very great, owes its
progress to native genius. It was not unacquainted with foreign artists,
but from them it disdained to borrow; and its masters never adopted any
other style on which they did not engraft a peculiarity and originality
of manner.</p>

<p>I might write much in praise of masters now living,<a
name="fnanchor_240" id="fnanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240"
class="fnanchor">[240]</a> but I propose not to enter on their merits,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg
366]</a></span>and shall leave them wholly to the judgment of posterity.
In other arts I indulge a greater latitude, but not frequently. I may
add with truth, that during the course of six centuries, the artists of
Florence have been fortunate in a government most auspicious to the fine
arts. The last princes however of the Medicean family had shewn more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg
367]</a></span>inclination than activity in patronizing them; and the
reign of the Emperor Francis I., though generally distinguished for
enterprize,<a name="fnanchor_241" id="fnanchor_241"></a><a
href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> was nevertheless that of
an absent sovereign. The accession of the Grand Duke Peter Leopold to
supreme power in Tuscany, in 1765, marked a new era in the history of
the arts. The palace and royal villas were repaired and embellished; and
amid the succession of undertakings that attracted the best artists,
painting was continually promoted. The improvement of the ducal gallery
was most opportune for it; and afforded new commissions to painters, and
new specimens of the art: for the Prince ordered all the inferior pieces
to be removed from the collection, and their place to be supplied by
vast numbers of choice pictures. Fine specimens of antique marbles were
likewise added: to him Florence owes the Niobe of Praxiteles,<a
name="fnanchor_242" id="fnanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242"
class="fnanchor">[242]</a> the Apollo, and other statues; the <ins
title="one word in the original">basso-relievos</ins>, and busts of the
Cæsars, which complete the grand series in the corridore: the cabinets
of the gallery were then only twelve in number, and they contained a
confused assemblage of paintings, statues, bronzes, and drawings,
antiquities and modern productions. He <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>reduced this chaos to
order; he separated the different kinds, assigned separate apartments to
each, made new purchases of what was before wanting, and increased the
number of cabinets to twenty-one. This great work, one branch of which
he was pleased to commit to my charge,<a name="fnanchor_243"
id="fnanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
was worthy of record. I laid it before the public, in 1782, in a memoir,
which was inserted also in the forty-seventh volume of the Journal of
Pisa. Whoever compares this book with the Description of the Gallery,
published in 1759, by Bianchi, will clearly perceive that Leopold was
rather a second founder than a restorer of that emporium of the fine
arts: so different is the arrangement, so remarkable are the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
additions to the building, to its ornaments, and to the articles it
contains.<a name="fnanchor_244" id="fnanchor_244"></a><a
href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> I have been diffuse in
my description of the antiquities which appeared to me deserving of more
particular elucidation; of the pictures I merely indicated the artist
and the subject. Since that period, other descriptions of the gallery,
by very able writers, have been given to the public, in which my
nomenclature and expositions of the antiquities have been adopted; but a
fuller and better catalogue of the paintings is given on the plan of
that of the imperial cabinet of Vienna, and similar works.</p>

<p>Ferdinand III. who now for five years has promoted the welfare of
Tuscany, succeeded no less to the throne of his august father, than to
the protection of the fine arts. The new buildings already completed, as
the right wing of the Pitti palace, or now begun, as the vestibule of
the Laurentian library, which is to be finished upon a design of
Michelangiolo, are matters foreign to my subject. Not so, however, are
the additions made by the prince to the gallery and the academy of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
design. To the first he has added a vast number of prints and pictures
of those schools in which it was formerly deficient; and the gallery is
increased by a collection of Venetian and another of French masters,
which are separately arranged in two cabinets.<a name="fnanchor_245"
id="fnanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
The academy, since 1785, had been as it were created anew by his father;
had obtained a new and magnificent edifice, new masters, and new
regulations, circumstances already well known over Europe, and here
unnecessary to be repeated. This institution, which required improvement
in some particulars, has been at length completed, and its apartments
and its splendour augmented by the son; seconded by the superintendence
of those accomplished connoisseurs, the Marchese Gerini, the Prior
Rucellai, and the Senator Alessandri. To the artists in every branch of
the fine arts which were before in Florence, he has recently added the
engraver Sig. Morghen, an ornament to the city and the state. The
obligations of the fine arts to Ferdinand III., are eloquently stated by
Sig. Cav. Puccini, a nobleman of Pistoia, and superintendant of the
ducal gallery, in an oration on the arts, pronounced not long ago in
this academy, of which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371"

since published, accompanied by engravings.<a name="fnanchor_246"

He was brother to Henry Hugford, a monk of Vallombrosa, to whom we owe,
in a great measure, the progress of working in <i>Scagliola</i>, which
was afterwards successfully practised in Florence by Lamberti Gori, his
pupil; and at this day by the Signor Pietro Stoppioni, who receives
numerous commissions. Although the portraits, and in general the
figures, of a variety of colours, are very pleasing, yet the
<i>dicromi</i>, or yellow figures upon a black ground, attract most
notice, copied from ancient vases formerly called Etruscan, and these
copies either form separate pictures, or are inserted for ornament in
tablets. The tragic poet Alfieri caused his epitaph to be inscribed on
one of these small tables covered with scagliola work. Being found after
his death, it quickly spread abroad, but was not inscribed on his tomb.
Upon another of these he had written the epitaph of a great personage,
whom he wished to be interred near him; and the two little tablets
united together folded one upon another in the way of a <i>dittico</i>
or small altar, or of a book, on the side of which was written
<i>Alfieri liber novissimus</i>. In this way others write, on tablets of
scagliola, fine precepts from scripture, a philosophy that comes from
and leads to heaven, intended to be placed in private sanctuaries, to
aid meditation in sight of the crucifix. The silver tablets I have seen
for the same purpose are more valuable, but less artificial.</p>

formerly director of the ducal gallery, who is also known by his other
literary labours, on the lives of the most eminent painters, by the life
of Dante, and by the learned dissertation on coins, appended to the
lives of the followers of Cortona. He arranged the collection of modern

It was necessary to confine myself thus in the preceding edition. In the
present we may give free scope to our commendation of Tommaso
Gherardini, a Florentine, and pupil to Meucci; and who, having completed
his studies in the schools of Venice and Bologna, succeeded admirably in
basso-relievo and chiaroscuro. He decorated a large hall in the Medicean
gallery in fresco, and painted likewise much in oil for the imperial
gallery of Vienna, for German and English gentlemen, and various
countries that have ornamented their collections. He shewed, at least
for his age, no less skill in fresco histories, which are seen in many
Florentine palaces and villas. The best of these are such as he executed
in mature age, or at his own suggestion; like his <i>Parnaso in
Toscana</i>, placed in the Casa Martelli, one of his patrons from his
early years; besides others in the noble houses of Ricciardi and Ambra.
He died in 1797; the senator Martelli, on the decease of the Archbishop
his uncle, and that of his father, continued his patronage to the
artist, and considers him as one who has reflected the greatest degree
of credit on his house. The clients of that family, from the time of
Donatello, have been numerous, a taste for the fine arts being
hereditary in the family. The master of the academy, Pietro Pedroni,
ought not to be here omitted; an oil painter of merit, whose four
pictures, executed subsequent to his studies at Parma and Rome, are an
ornament to his native place. Owing to ill health, he produced little
during his residence at Florence, which, added to other disappointments,
induced him, always the best resource, to travel. If not a rare painter,
he was at least an able master: profound in theory, and eloquent in
conveying his knowledge to his pupils, of whom history will treat in the
ensuing age. Their success, their affection and esteem for Pedroni, is
the best eulogy on him which I can transmit to posterity.</p>

It was the cabinet of antiquities, not then arranged. In each class I
have noticed the additions of Leopold. To the busts of the Cæsars I was
able to add about forty, some of which had been purchased, and others
removed from the royal palaces and villas. See the Description above
quoted, p. 34. The collection of heads of philosophers and illustrious
men was almost all new. I give an account of it in p. 85. The series of
busts of the Medicean family was completed at the same time, and Latin
inscriptions were added, which are to be found in various descriptions
of the gallery, with some errors, that are not to be attributed to me,
but to the printers; and this remark applies to other royal epitaphs, as
published in many books. The cabinet of antique bronzes is described in
p. 55. For the collection of antique earthenware, see p. 157; of Greek
and Latin inscriptions on stones, see p. 81. For the Hetruscan and
carved cinerary urns, see p. 46. This cabinet I also endeavoured to
illustrate in <i>Saggio di Lingua Etrusca</i>, &amp;c. published at

celebrated Sig. Ab. Eckell, see p. 101; the others, arranged by Sig.

He employed in this work the highly esteemed Sig. Cav. Puccini, from
whom I understand, that almost a third of the pictures now in the
gallery were placed there by the munificence of Ferdinand. Sig. Puccini
has arranged them in a manner so symmetrical and instructive as to form
a model for all other collections.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_246"><span class="label">[246]</span></a> In 1801
Lodovico I. began his reign in Tuscany. Dying shortly after, he was
succeeded by the infant Carlo I., under the regency of the Queen-mother
Maria Louisa. From this period the arts have experienced new patronage
and encouragement. The very copious and select Salvetti library has been
appropriated for the use of the academy; a noble example to all parts of
Italy, possessing similar institutions. A new improvement also here
made, is the reunion in one place of masters in scagliola, and mosaic
work, gems, and the restoring of pictures, an occupation recently
introduced; and in place of a master, who formerly presided, a director,
with greater authority and emolument, has been appointed. Sig. Pietro
Benvenuti, whom I dare not venture to commend as he deserves, for he is
still living, was selected for this charge. The addition of casts also
by our new rulers is of great utility, in particular those from the
works of the celebrated Canova, who has been requested to produce a new
statue of Venus, on the model of the Medicean, lost to us by the chance
of war. The honour conferred by the queen regent upon the arts, deserves
likewise a place in history; who, in the meeting of the academy, held in
1803, Sig. Alessandri being president, distributed rewards to the young
students, and encouraged them to do well. It was upon this occasion that
the same Cavaliere Puccini, secretary to the institution, delivered
another excellent discourse, intended to prove that the pursuit of the
fine arts forms one of the most expeditious and least perilous paths to
human glory;&mdash;a discourse that, equally for the credit of the
writer and of the fine arts, was given to the world at Florence, in the
year 1804.</p>

<h4 class="p4">SIENESE SCHOOL.</h4>

<h4>EPOCH I.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><i>The old Masters.</i></div>

<p class="p2">The Sienese is the lively school of a lively people; and
is so agreeable in the selection of the colours and the air of the
heads, that foreigners are captivated, and sometimes even prefer it to
the Florentine. But this gaiety of style forms not the only reason of
this preference; there is another, which few have attended to, and none
have ever brought forward. The choicest productions of the painters of
Siena are all in the churches of that place; and he who wishes to become
acquainted with the school, after having seen these, need not be very
solicitous to visit the private collections, which are numerous and well
filled. In Florence it is otherwise: no picture of Vinci, of Bonarruoti,
of Rosso, is to be seen in public; none of the finest productions of
Andrea, or of Frate, and few of any other master who has best supported
the credit of the school: many of the churches abound in pictures of the
third and fifth epochs; which are certainly respectable, but do not
excite astonishment like the works of the Razzi, the Vanni, and other
first rate <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg
373]</a></span>artists, every where to be met with in Siena. They are,
moreover, two different schools, and ought not to be confounded together
in any work of art; possessing, for a long period of time, different
governments, other heads of schools, other styles; and not affected by
the same changes. A comparison between the two schools is drawn by P.
della Valle,<a name="fnanchor_247" id="fnanchor_247"></a><a
href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> whom we have mentioned,
and shall afterwards mention with respect; and his opinion appears to
be, that the Florentine is most philosophical, the Sienese the most
poetical. He remarks on this head, that the school of Siena, from its
very beginning, displays a peculiar talent for invention; animating with
lively and novel images the stories it represents; filling them with
allegory, and forming them into spirited and well constructed poetic
compositions. This originates in the elevated and fervid genius of the
people, that no less aids the painter, whose poetry is addressed to the
eye, than the bard who yields it to the ear. In the latter, and also in
extemporary poets, the city abounds, and still maintains in public
estimation, those laurels, which, after Petrarca and Tasso, her Perfetti
won in the capital. He likewise observes that those artists particularly
attended to expression. Nor was this difficult, in a city so adverse to
dissimulation as Siena, whose natural disposition and education have
adapted the tongue and countenance to express the emotions of the heart.
This vivacity of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374"
id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>genius has perhaps prevented their
attaining perfection in design, which is not the great attribute of
those masters, as it is reckoned of the Florentines. To sum up all, the
character of the school of Siena is not so original as that of some
others; and we shall find, during its best period, that some of its
artists distinctly imitated the style of other painters. With regard to
the number of its artists, Siena has been prolific in the proportion of
its population; its artists were numerous while it had many citizens;
but on the decrease of the latter, its professors of the fine arts also
diminished, until every trace of a school was lost.</p>

<p>The accounts of the early painters of Siena are rather confused
during the three first centuries by the plurality of the Guidi, the
Mini, the Lippi, the Vanni (abbreviations of Giacomo, Filippo,
Giovanni), and such sort of proper names as are used without a surname:
hence it is not sufficient to peruse only such accounts; we must reflect
on them and compare them. They are scattered in many histories of the
city, especially in Ugurgieri, who was pleased to entitle his work <i>Le
Pompe Sanesi</i>; in the Diary of Girolamo Gigli; and in several works
of the indefatigable Cav. Gio. Pecci, whom we have before noticed. Many
manuscripts, rich in anecdotes of painting, still remain in the
libraries: of this number are the histories of Sigismondo Tizio, of
Castiglione, who lived at Siena from 1482 to 1528; <i>the Cathedral of
Siena</i>, minutely described by Alfonzo Landi; the <i>Treatise on
old</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg
375]</a></span><i>Paintings</i> of Giulio Mancini; and some
<i>Memoirs</i> of Uberto Benvoglienti, whom Muratori denominates
<i>diligentissimus rerum suæ patriæ investigator</i>. From these, and
other sources,<a name="fnanchor_248" id="fnanchor_248"></a><a
href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> P. della Valle has drawn
what is contained in the Lettere Sanesi, and repeated in the notes on
Vasari concerning the school of Siena. By the work of Della Valle it has
acquired a celebrity to which it has long been entitled. I take him for
my guide in the documents and anecdotes which he has given to the
public;<a name="fnanchor_249" id="fnanchor_249"></a><a
href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> in the older authorities
I follow Vasari and Baldinucci in many circumstances, but dissent from
them in others: and hostile to error, and anxious for the truth, I shall
pursue the same plan with regard to the historians of the school of
Siena. I shall omit many names of old masters, of whom no works now
remain, and here and there shall add a few modern artists who have come
to my knowledge, by the examination of pictures, or by the perusal of
books.</p>

<p>The origin of the Sienese school is deduced either from the crusades
in the east, whence some Grecian painter has been brought to Siena; or
from Pisa, which, as we have seen, had its first artists from Greece. On
such a question every <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376"
id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>one may judge for himself: to me the
data necessary for resolving it appear to be wanting. I know that Italy
was never destitute of painters, and artists who wrought in miniature;
that from such, without any Grecian aid, or example, some Italian
schools took their origin. Siena must have had them in the twelfth
century. The <i>Ordo officiorum Senensis Ecclesiæ</i> which is preserved
in the library of the academy at Florence, was written in the beginning
of the thirteenth century, and exhibits initial letters, surrounded with
illuminations of little stories and ornaments of animals. They are
painted in vermilion, in a very hard and meagre style; but they are
valuable on account of their era, 1213, in which they were executed by
Oderico Canonico of Siena.<a name="fnanchor_250"
id="fnanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
Similar books were ornamented by the same painter in the parchment of
the leaves, and painted on the covers without;<a name="fnanchor_251"
id="fnanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
and afford a proof that thus the art of ornamenting with miniatures
might lead to large compositions. All, however, more or less, savour of
the Greek design; either because the Italians were originally disciples
of the Greeks, dispersed over Italy, or because <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>they regarded the
Grecian masters as models, and ventured not to attempt much beyond
them.</p>

<p>The most ancient pictures in the city, the Madonna <i>of the
Graces</i>, the Madonna of Tressa, the Madonna of Bethlehem, a S. Peter
in the church dedicated to that saint, and a S. John the Baptist,
surrounded by many small historical representations at S. Petronilla,
are believed to be older than 1200; but it is by no means clear that
they are the works of Italians, though often believed such from their
initial characters, plaister, and design. On the two last the names of
the saints near the figures are in Latin characters; a circumstance,
however, which does not prove an Italian painter. On the mosaic works at
Venice, on the Madonna of Camerino, brought from Smyrna,<a
name="fnanchor_252" id="fnanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252"
class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and on other pictures executed by the Greeks
for Italian cities, ignorant of their language, they wrote, or got
others to write, inscriptions in Latin; and they did the same on
statues.<a name="fnanchor_253" id="fnanchor_253"></a><a
href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The method of painting
on gilt plaister, which we observe in some old pictures, decidedly
Italian, is no argument; for I have several times observed a similar
practice in what was unquestionably the work of a Greek artist. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg
378]</a></span>drawing of the features in those pictures, the grimness
of the aspect, and the composition of the stories, all accord with the
productions of the Greeks. They may, therefore, have been painted by
Greek artists, or by a scholar, or, at least, by an imitator of the
Greeks. Who, then, can determine whence the artist came, whether he was
a restorer of painting, and whether he executed those paintings at
Siena, or sent them from some other place? This is certain, that
painting quickly established itself at Siena, sent out roots, and
rapidly multiplied its blossoms.</p>

<p>The series of painters known by name commences with Guido, or
Guidone, already noticed in the beginning of this volume. He flourished
before Cimabue of Florence saw the light; and seems to have been at the
same time an illuminator of manuscripts and a painter. The writers of
Siena have declaimed against Vasari and Baldinucci for omitting this
artist; notices of whom could not have escaped the former, who was many
times at Siena; nor the latter, who was made acquainted with them before
the publication of his <i>Decennali</i>. Cav. Marmi, a learned and
celebrated Florentine, thus notices the omission in one of his
letters.<a name="fnanchor_254" id="fnanchor_254"></a><a
href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> "Baldinucci laboured to
make us credit the restoration of painting by Cimabue and Giotto; and to
give stability to his hypothesis, it is probable that he omitted to make
any mention of the painters who, independent of the two just named,
departed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg
379]</a></span>from the raw and feeble manner of the Greeks." And Guido
certainly left it not a little behind, in his picture of the Virgin, now
hung up in the Malevolti chapel in the church of S. Domenico. On it he
has thus inscribed his name and the date:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0"><i>Me Guido de Senis diebus depinxit amenis</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Quem Christus lenis nullis velit agere
poenis</i>.</span>
<span class="i12">An. 1221.</span>
</div>

<p>And this example was often followed by the masters of this school, to
the great benefit of the history of painting. The countenance of the
Virgin is lovely, and participates not in the stern aspect that is
characteristic of the Greeks; we may discover some trace of a new style
in the drapery. The Madonnas of Cimabue which are at Florence, the one
in the church of the Trinity, the other in S. Maria Novella, are not,
however, inferior. In them we may discern the improvement of the art; a
more vivid colouring, flesh tints more true; a more natural attitude of
the head of the infant, while the accompaniments of the throne, and of
the glory of angels, proclaim a superior style.</p>

<p>On this subject I make two remarks, in which I widely dissent from
the opinion of the author of the Sienese Letters, without committing any
breach of our long established friendship. The one is, that to prove
Guido superior to Cimabue, he frequently compares the Madonna of S.
Domenico, which is the only one of his pictures which he mentions,<a
name="fnanchor_255" id="fnanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255"
class="fnanchor">[255]</a> with the paintings of Cimabue, which <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>are
numerous, and full of subject; and without setting any value on the
colouring, the fertility of invention, and the various other qualities
in which the Florentine surpassed the artist of Siena, he dwells on
certain little particulars, in which it appears that Guido was superior.
An artist of whom it is not known that he ever attempted any picture but
Madonnas, might become more or less perfect in this subject; but
painting is not so much indebted to him, as to one who has carried it to
the higher walks of the art; a merit which Marco of Siena, a writer not
inclined to favour the Florentines, denies not to Cimabue, as we shall
find in the fourth book. The other circumstance alluded to is, that when
he mentions a picture which does honour to the fame of Cimabue, he
attempts to discredit its history, and the tradition; as I have already
observed with regard to the two large pictures in the church of Assisi,
and am now under the necessity of remarking with regard to the two
Madonnas at Florence above mentioned. He "strongly suspects"<a
name="fnanchor_256" id="fnanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256"
class="fnanchor">[256]</a> them to be the work of Mino da Turrita, since
mosaic, in which Mino was expert, is there represented by a skilful
hand; and Cimabue was not dexterous in that art; as if a painter could
not represent buildings without being an architect, or garments without
knowing how to cut them out, or drapery without being versed in the art
of weaving. He even doubts whether Giotto visited France, for, had this
been the case, he, and not Simone da Siena, would have painted <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>the
portrait of Laura, as if history did not inform us that Giotto visited
that country about 1316, long before the period when Petrarca first
became enamoured of that beauty. He has introduced some other
speculations, which he would not have admitted, had he not been betrayed
into it, almost involuntarily, by a system which has some probable
foundation, but is carried to an extravagant length. I should have been
silent on this subject; but when writing of these artists it became me
to recollect that the <i>unicuique suum</i> was no less the duty of the
historian than the judge.</p>

<p>The authors of chronicles require correction on the era of this
painter. The most undoubted picture of Guido is that bearing the date
1221, for the other in the church of S. Bernardino, dated 1262, is
ascribed to him without sufficient evidence. It is hardly probable that
he who was so eminent in a new art in 1221, was still alive in 1295, as
is affirmed by some,<a name="fnanchor_257" id="fnanchor_257"></a><a
href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> on the faith of a sum of
money paid to one Guido, a painter. The celebrated Guido must then have
been at least 105 years of age: it is more probable that he was dead,
and the name applied to another Guido, without any danger of a
mistake.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the elder Guido instructed F. Mino, or
Giacomino da Turrita, the celebrated artist in mosaic, of whom we have
spoken in the first book. On the era of Mino also much has been written
without sufficient authority. Baldinucci says he died about 1300; and
omits to mention in his life that he was employed in 1225;<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
although this date is legible on the mosaic of Mino in the church of S.
Giovanni at Florence, in letters a cubit in length.<a
name="fnanchor_258" id="fnanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258"
class="fnanchor">[258]</a> This circumstance has likewise escaped the
historians of Siena, some of whom have prolonged his life to the year
1298, on the authority of payment made to Minuccio, a painter; and
others have extended it to about 1200, on account of the tomb of
Boniface VIII. which is said to be the work of Turrita. The utmost
period that can be granted them is about 1290: for Titi observes, in his
<i>Description of the Paintings in Rome</i>, that Mino finished the
mosaic of S. Maria Maggiore in 1289, and died, after beginning another
in S. Giovanni Laterano, which was completed by Gaddo Gaddi in 1292.
This renders it extremely doubtful that F. Mino was taught painting by
Guido, that he imparted it not only to Giotto, whom, for other reasons,
we have excluded from his school (p. 20) but to the Sienese artists,
Memmi and Lorenzetti,<a name="fnanchor_259" id="fnanchor_259"></a><a
href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and even that he was a
painter; all which is founded on the following memorandum, under the
year 1289, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg
383]</a></span>in a manuscript in the library of Siena: "Paid on the
twelfth day of August, nineteen lire to Master Mino, the painter, who
painted the Virgin Mary, and other SS. in the council room of the public
palace, the balance, &amp;c."</p>

<p>He who is here denominated <i>Maestro</i> Mino, not Fra Mino; who is
sometimes called Minuccio, a diminutive not fitted for an old monk; and
appears to have been employed in Siena when Fra Mino was at Rome, is
another artist. Thus we discover another eminent painter of the name of
Mino, or Minuccio, who seems to be in reality the author of the picture
of 1289, above alluded to, which remained in the council hall even
within my memory, and of others, down to 1298. He there represented the
Virgin and Child, surrounded by angels, and under a canopy, supported by
Apostles and the patron saints of the city. The size of the figures, the
invention and the distribution of the work, are surprising for that age;
of the other qualities one cannot speak with certainty; for it was
repaired in 1321 by Simone da Siena, and there are beauties in the
features and the drapery that can be ascribed only to the restorer. The
mistake thus occasioned by the same name being cleared up, the system of
the learned author of the Lettere Sanesi, is in part confirmed, and in
part falls to the ground. He is right in refusing to Giotto certain
Sienese pupils, referred to him only from traces of a more modern style;
for we here discover an artist who made some advances towards the new
manner even previous to Giotto, who, in 1289, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>was only thirteen years
of age. Now this Mino, and Duccio, of whom we shall soon treat, might
certainly have formed pupils able to compete with the school of Giotto,
and even in length of years to surpass Giotto himself. There is no
reason, however, to prefer the Sienese painters to Cimabue, on the
strength of this painting, as the author in question has so often done.
Comparison ought to be employed between painter and painter, between
contemporary and contemporary. F. Mino, to whom this single picture was
attributed, is now shewn to have been merely a mosaic worker: Mino or
Minuccio began to be known when Cimabue was fifty years of age; and is
the author of a single work, not so free from retouches, nor so large as
that of Assisi, already described. The comparison then is not just.</p>

<p>Every school thinks itself sufficiently honoured when it can produce
two or three painters of the thirteenth century: the school of Siena is
peculiarly rich in them, and these are recorded in the twenty-fifth
letter <i>On the disciples of Guido</i>. As usual I shall omit the names
of those least entitled to recollection. I will not affirm that all of
them proceeded from the school of Guido; for in a city where the fine
arts flourished so rapidly, masters unknown to us may have been
produced. Much less will I ascribe artists of other cities to this
school. In the manuscripts of Mancini, one Bonaventura da Lucca is
mentioned, who is the Berlingieri already mentioned.<a
name="fnanchor_260" id="fnanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260"
class="fnanchor">[260]</a> I neither assign him <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>to Guido nor to Giunta.
Who can tell whether Lucca had not also in those early times an original
school, now unknown to us? Setting aside uncertain points therefore, we
can only assert, that after the middle of the century, Siena abounded in
painters, more, perhaps, than any other city of Italy; and the causes of
this are as follows.</p>

<p>The cathedral was begun several years before, in a style of
magnificence suited to the lordly views of the citizens. It was not a
work to be completed in a short time: hence it was frequently
interrupted, and a long period had elapsed before it was finished.
During this time many architects (<i>magistri lapidum</i>) and sculptors
either were invited from other places, or were reared up in the city;
and in 1250 they formed a corporate body, and required particular
laws.<a name="fnanchor_261" id="fnanchor_261"></a><a
href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Although nothing is
ascertained with regard to their mode of study, it is natural to suppose
that the study of sculpture contributed to the advancement of painting,
a sister art. The celebrated battle of Monte Aperto, in which the people
of Siena defeated the Florentines, happened in 1260. This victory
produced an era of peace and opulence to the city, and encouraged both
in public and in private the arts depending on luxury. The victory was
ascribed to the interference of the blessed Virgin Mary, to whom the
city was consecrated; the adoration of her votaries increased, and her
images were multiplied in the streets, and in all other places; and
thence painting <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386"
id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>obtained fresh encouragement, and new
followers.</p>

<p>Ugolino da Siena should be referred to this era; he died decrepid in
1339, and consequently might have been born before 1260. We cannot agree
with Vasari, who insinuates that he was the scholar of Cimabue; nor with
Baldinucci, who ingrafts him on his <i>Tree</i>; nor yet with others who
assert that he was the pupil of Guido; for the latter must have been
dead when Ugolino was very young. That he was educated in Siena, seems
to me highly probable, from the number of masters then in that city, and
because the colouring of his Madonna of Orsanmichele at Florence is in
the style of the old school of Siena; less strong and less true than
that of Cimabue and the Florentines. This fact appears to me of
importance, for it depends on the mechanism of the art, which was
different in different schools. Design at that early period savoured
more or less of the Greeks; and in this respect Ugolino adhered to them
too closely. "He painted pictures and chapels over all Italy," says
Vasari; and if I am not mistaken he came to Florence after his travels,
and at length died at Siena.</p>

<p>Duccio di Boninsegna is another master of this age, of whom I shall
speak in another place, as the inventor of a new species of painting.
Tizio says he was the pupil of Segna, an artist now almost unknown in
Siena. He must, however, have enjoyed great celebrity in his day among
his countrymen; for Tizio informs us that he painted a picture at<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
Arezzo, containing a figure which he pronounces excellent and highly
esteemed. He has transmitted to us the following remarkable testimony
concerning Duccio: "<i>Ducius</i> Senensis inter ejusdem opificii
artifices eâ tempestate primarius; ex cujus officinâ veluti ex equo
Trojano pictores egregii prodierunt."</p>

<p>The <i>eâ tempestate</i> refers to 1311, when Giotto was at Avignon;
and when Duccio was employed on the picture that still exists in the
opera-house, which was completed in three years, and almost forms an era
in the art. It was large enough to have formed a picture for the great
altar of the metropolitan church for which it was intended. On the side
facing the people he painted large figures of the Virgin, and of various
saints; on that fronting the choir he represented scriptural subjects,
in many compartments, in which he introduced a vast number of figures a
palm in length. Pius II. relates in his Annals of Siena, which were
never published, that it cost 2,000 florins; others raise it to 3,000;
but not so much on account of the workmanship as the profusion of gold
and ultramarine. The style is generally thought to approach the Greek
manner; the work, however, is the most copious in figures, and among the
best executed productions of that age. Duccio was employed in many parts
of Tuscany, and in the church of the Trinity at Florence he painted an
Annunciation which, in the opinion of Baldinucci, "leaves no doubt that
he was a scholar of Giotto, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388"
id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>or of his disciples." But this will not
be granted or believed by those who have seen it; for both the colouring
and the style are totally dissimilar. Chronology, too, opposes the
conclusion; unless we introduce here also a confusion, arising from
artists with similar names: Duccio painted from 1282,<a
name="fnanchor_262" id="fnanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262"
class="fnanchor">[262]</a> and died about 1340.<a name="fnanchor_263"
id="fnanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263"
class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>The history becomes more complete, when we arrive at the celebrated
Simone Memmi, or Simone di Martino,<a name="fnanchor_264"
id="fnanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
the painter of Laura, and the friend of Petrarca, who has celebrated him
in two sonnets that will hand him down to the latest posterity. The poet
has also eulogized him in his letters, where he thus speaks: "duos ego
novi pictores egregios ... Joctum Florentinum civem, cujus inter
modernos fama ingens est, et Simonem Senensem;" which is not, however,
comparing him to Giotto, to whom he pays a double compliment, but it is
giving Memmi the next rank. In such a convenient place the poet would
not, in my opinion, have omitted <i>Jocti discipulum</i>, had he been
acquainted with such a circumstance: but he appears to have no knowledge
of it; and this renders it doubtful whether Simone was the pupil of
Giotto at Rome, notwithstanding the assertion of Vasari, who adds that
the latter was then engaged <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389"
id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>in the mosaic of the <i>Navicella</i>.
The writers of Siena contradict him with good reason; for in 1298 Simone
was only fourteen years of age.<a name="fnanchor_265"
id="fnanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
They reckon him the scholar of their Mino, and certainly he derived much
from the large fresco before noticed: but as he retouched it himself we
cannot put much faith on the resemblance. His colouring is more vivid
than that of the followers of Giotto, and in floridness it seems a
prelude to Baroccio. But if he was not the scholar of Giotto, he may
have assisted him in some of his works, or, perhaps, studied him
closely, as many eminent painters have often done with the best masters.
This may account for his imitating Giotto so admirably in S. Peter's at
Rome; a merit which procured him an invitation to the papal court at
Avignon, where he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390"
id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>died. The picture of the Vatican has
perished; but some of his other works still exist in Italy; and they are
not so numerous at Siena as in Pisa and Florence. In the Campo Santo of
Pisa we find various actions of S. Ranieri, and the celebrated
Assumption of the Virgin, amid a choir of angels, who seem actually
floating in the air, and celebrating the triumph. Memmi was excellent in
this species of composition, as I believe, from the numerous pictures of
this subject which he painted at Siena, where there is one at the church
of S. John, which is more copious but not more beautiful than that at
Pisa. Some of his larger works may be seen in the chapter house of the
Spanish Friars at Florence; several histories of Christ, of S. Domenico,
and of S. Peter Martyr; and there the Order of the Preaching Friars are
poetically represented as engaged in the service of the church, in
rejecting innovators, and in luring souls to paradise. Vasari, to whom
the inventions of Memmi appear "not those of a master of that age, but
of a most excellent modern artist," especially praises the last: and,
indeed, it might be supposed that it was suggested by Petrarch, did not
a comparison of dates refute such an idea. The picture was painted in
1332, and Simone went not to France till 1336; what is said about the
portrait of Laura in the chapterhouse is a mere fable. Taddeo Gaddi, an
undoubted pupil of the improved and dignified school of Giotto, was
there his competitor; and as far surpassed Memmi in the qualities of
that school, as he was excelled <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391"
id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>by the latter in spirit, in variety of
the heads and attitudes, in fancy of the draperies, and in originality
of composition. Simone paved the way to more complex pictures, and
extended them over a whole façade, so as to be taken in at one glance of
the eye; whereas Giotto used to divide a large surface into many
compartments, in each of which he painted an historical picture.</p>

<p>Although I do not usually dwell on miniature painting, I cannot
resist mentioning one which is to be seen in the Ambrosian library at
Milan, which appears to me a singular production. In that place, there
is a manuscript of Virgil, with the commentary of Servius, which
formerly belonged to Petrarca. In the frontispiece is a miniature that
is reasonably conjectured to have been suggested to Simone by the poet,
who has subjoined the following verses:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0"><i>Mantua Virgilium qui talia carmina
finxit,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sena tulit Simonem digito qui talia
pinxit.</i></span>
</div>

<p>The artist has represented Virgil sitting in the attitude of writing,
and with his eyes raised to heaven, invoking the favour of the Muses.
Æneas is before him in the garb and with the demeanour of a warrior,
and, pointing with his sword, intimates the subject of the Æneid. The
Bucolics are represented by a shepherd, and the Georgics by a
husbandman; both of whom are on a lower foreground of the piece, and
appear listening to the strain. Servius, in the mean time, appears
drawing aside a veil of great delicacy and transparency, to intimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg
392]</a></span>that his readings unveil what would otherwise have
remained obscure and doubtful to the reader of that divine poet. An
account of this picture is contained in a letter of the secretary Ab.
Carlo Bianconi,<a name="fnanchor_266" id="fnanchor_266"></a><a
href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> where the author praises
the originality of the idea, the colouring and harmony of the picture,
the propriety and variety in the costume according with the subject. He
also remarks a little rudeness in the design, more of truth than of
beauty in the heads, and the largeness of the hands; that usually,
indeed, were the characteristics of every school at this period.</p>

<p>Simone had a relation named Lippo Memmi, whom he himself instructed
in the art. Although he was not equal in genius to Simone, he succeeded
admirably in imitating his manner, and, aided by his designs, produced
pictures that might have passed for the work of the former, had he not
inscribed them with his name. When he wrought without such assistance
there is a manifest mediocrity in his invention and design; but he is
still a good colourist. A picture executed by them both is preserved in
S. Ansano di Castelvecchio of Siena.<a name="fnanchor_267"
id="fnanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg
393]</a></span>In Ancona, Assisi, and other places, pictures existed
that were begun by the former, and finished by the latter. There is a
picture wholly the work of Lippo in Siena; and the author of the
Description of Pisa records one at the church of S. Paul in that place,
which is not without merit. In my first edition, implicitly following
the writers of chronicles, I mentioned a Cecco di Martino as the brother
of Simone. But on considering that he flourished about 1380, and that
there was a less celebrated Simon Martino, in Siena, about 1350,
mentioned by Cittadini, I do not judge it right to follow their
authority.</p>

<p>An artist named Lorenzo, and familiarly Lorenzetto, was the father of
another family of painters: he had a son named Ambrogio, who is surnamed
Lorenzetti by historians. A large picture by this artist, on which he
subscribes himself <i>Ambrosius Laurentii</i>, is to be seen in the
public palace, and may be designated a poem of moral precepts. The vices
of a bad government are there represented under different aspects, and
with appropriate symbols; accompanied by verses explanatory of their
nature and consequences. The Virtues, too, are there personified with
suitable emblems: and the whole is adapted to form governors and
politicians for the republic, animated by the spirit of genuine
patriotism alone. Had there been a greater variety in the countenances
of the figures, and a superior arrangement <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>in the piece, it would
have been little inferior to the finest pictures in the Campo Santo of
Pisa. Siena possesses many of his frescos and large pictures; but they
are not so surprising as his smaller works, in which he appears as the
forerunner of B. Angelico, whom we have commended in another place. I
have observed nothing similar in his contemporaries; and it possesses a
nationality of character that prevents his being confounded with the
followers of Giotto: the ideas, the colouring, and the draperies, are
wholly different. In a similar taste is a picture in the possession of
Sig. Abate Ciaccheri, librarian to the university of Siena, where
Ambrogio painted some very original works, in which he very far
surpassed the Orcagni. His style was admired in Florence; where, to
please his friends, who were desirous of seeing a specimen of his art,
he painted several pieces from the life of S. Nicholas, in the church of
S. Proculus, that were afterwards transferred to the abbey.</p>

<p>Another son of Lorenzo was called Pietro, and, in conjunction with
his brother, painted the Presentation, and Nuptials of Our Lady, in the
hospital of Siena, on which the following inscription was legible:
<i>Hoc opus fecit Petrus Laurentii et Ambrosius ejus frater, 1335</i>.
The inscription is preserved by Cav. Pecci, who in 1720, when the
painting was destroyed, transcribed it most opportunely for correcting
Vasari, who had read <i>Petrus Laurati</i> instead of <i>Laurentii</i>
in another inscription; from which he concluded this artist not <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>to
be the brother of Ambrogio; and from some similarity between his style
and that of Giotto, had concluded that he was the disciple of the
latter: but it is highly improbable that with such a father and such a
brother, Pietro would have gone from home for instruction. Vasari gives,
however, a most favourable opinion of this illustrious Sienese, which
may suffice to vindicate his impartiality. He says of one of his
pictures, "that it was executed with a better design and in a superior
manner to any thing that Tuscany had then seen;" and in another place he
asserts, that Pietro "became a better master than either Cimabue or
Giotto." What could he have said further? might it have been asserted
that he was, if not the disciple of Giotto, at least his fellow student
in the school of F. Mino? (Vasari, tom. ii. p. 78. ed. Sen.) But
granting that Giotto was not his master, how are we to believe him his
fellow student? The first pictures of Giotto are traced to 1295; those
of Pietro to 1327. And where, when, or to whom did F. Mino teach
painting? Pietro's historical picture of the Fathers dell' Eremo remains
in the Campo Santo of Pisa, where, in conformity with ecclesiastical
history, he has painted the various discipline of those recluses. This
picture, if I am not mistaken, is richer in ideas, more original, and
better conceived than any one in that place. In the ducal gallery there
is a copy of this picture, if not a duplicate by the artist himself: the
taste of the colouring certainly belongs not to the Florentine, but to
the Sienese school, of that period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg
396]</a></span>After painting had attained so high a degree of
excellence in Siena, it was liable to decline, both from the usual lot
of the most auspicious eras, to which an age of servile imitation, and
of hurried execution, generally succeeds, and also from the terrible
plague which, in 1348, desolated Italy and Europe; sweeping off
distinguished masters and pupils in every school. Siena, however, did
not lose her Lorenzetti, who constituted her ornament for several years;
but if her population at one time equalled 75,000, it was afterwards
greatly diminished. She could, however, still vie in the number of her
artists with Florence itself. This clearly appears from <i>The Statutes
of the Painters of Siena</i>,<a name="fnanchor_268"
id="fnanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
published by P. della Valle, in his first volume, letter sixteen. They
are drawn up with the characteristic simplicity, clearness, and
precision of the thirteenth century; and are a very admirable body of
regulations for the due propriety and direction of artists, and for the
honour of the art. We can discern that this society consisted of
cultivated and well educated persons; and it does not excite
astonishment to find that, democratic in government as Siena then was,
the highest magistrates of the republic were sometimes elected from
among the professors of the art. They formed a body-corporate; not
merely a fraternity, nor an academy of design; and received their
charter, not from the bishop but from the city, or the republic in 1355.
Some have conjectured that those statutes are as old as the preceding
century; and that they <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397"
id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>were translated into Italian from the
Latin about 1291: for Tizio informs us that, in this year, "Statuta
maternâ linguâ edita sunt ad ambiguitates tollendas." But Tizio must
have meant the statutes concerning wool, and others then existing; and
those of the artists may have been framed at a subsequent period.
Indeed, the manner in which they are drawn up, without a reference to
preceding ordinances, indicates a first edition. If there were statutes
published in the vulgar tongue in 1291, why was the sanction of the law
deferred for 66 years? or why are the new not distinguished from the
old, as is usual in similar codes?</p>

<p>In the code to which I refer, the names of a great number of artists
are inscribed, who lived after 1350 and at the beginning of the next
century. With the exception of a few who merit some consideration I
shall pass them over in silence as I did in the Florentine school. I
find among them Andrea di Guido,<a name="fnanchor_269"
id="fnanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
Jacomo di Frate Mino, and Galgano di Maestro Minuccio; and I bring these
forward to confirm what I have before observed, that painters of the
same name have introduced confusion into the history of this school. I
also find there N. Tedesco, Vannino da Perugia, Lazzaro da Orvieto,
Niccolò da Norcia, Antonio da Pistoia, and other foreign artists: thence
I infer that Siena, like a university for painting, had furnished <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg
398]</a></span>masters to various cities of Italy, and other countries.
We here meet with some painters of whom there still remains some trace
in history, or in the inscriptions on pictures. Martino di Bartolommeo
is the artist who, in 1405, painted the Translation of the Body of S.
Crescentius at the cathedral, and of whom a still better picture remains
at S. Antonio Abate. His family name brings to mind Bartolommeo
Bolonghino, or Bolgarino, mentioned by Vasari as the best pupil of
Pietro Laurati, and the painter of some excellent pictures in Siena, and
other parts of Italy. He was a man of rank, and obtained the honour of
the magistracy. Andrea di Vanni is undoubtedly the painter of the S.
Sebastian in the convent of S. Martin, and of the Madonna surrounded by
saints in that of S. Francis; an artist not unknown beyond the limits of
his native country, especially in Naples, where he painted before 1373.
He was likewise employed in public embassies, and, like another Rubens,
was a magistrate, and ambassador of the republic to the Pope: and was
honored by S. Catherine of Siena, who, in one of her letters, gives him
some excellent advice on the subject of government.</p>

<p>About the year 1370 flourished Berna, (i. e. Bernardo) da Siena, of
whom Vasari says, that "he was the first who painted animals correctly;"
and at the same time allows him no common merit in the human figure,
especially in what regards expression. One of his frescos remains in the
parish church of Arezzo, more praiseworthy on account<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span> of
the extremities, in which he was superior to many of that age, than for
the drapery or the colouring, in which many artists surpassed him. He
died in the prime of life, about the year 1380, at S. Gimignano, after
having made considerable progress in a copious work, consisting of some
subjects from sacred history, that still remains in that parish church.
The work was continued with a superior colouring, but with a less pure
design, by Giovanni d'Asciano, who is his reputed scholar. The whole
still exists, and thirteen of the pictures, or perhaps more, are the
work of the scholar who exercised his art at Florence, under the
protection of the Medicean family, much respected by his fellow artists.
As those two painters lived long abroad, I find no mention of them in
the catalogue just quoted. There is a well executed altar-piece in
Venice, with the name <i>Bernardinus de Senis</i>. Some of his pictures
have been discovered in the diocese of Siena, by the Archbishop
Zondadari, who has formed a good collection of ancient pictures of the
Sienese school. In these pictures Berna appears to be a pretty good
colourist, a talent which he does not display in his frescos. Luca di
Tomè, another scholar of Berna, noticed by Vasari, is there mentioned.
One of his Holy Families remains at S. Quirico, in the convent of the
Capuchins, and bears the date of 1367. It has not sufficient softness,
but in other respects is very reputable.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the fifteenth century, not<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
only individual painters, but whole families of artists had multiplied,
in which the art for a long series of years descended from father to
son. This circumstance contributed greatly to the progress of painting:
for the master, who is likewise the father, teaches without any feeling
of jealousy, and generally aims at forming a pupil superior to himself.
The family of the Fredi, or the Bartoli, became celebrated beyond all
the rest. The reputation of Taddeo, who began to be distinguished in the
fourteenth century, rose very high. In the records he is styled
<i>Thaddæus magistri Bartholi magistri Fredi</i>,<a name="fnanchor_270"
id="fnanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
from his father<a name="fnanchor_271" id="fnanchor_271"></a><a
href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> and grandfather, artists
of some name. By him, "as the best master of the age," says Vasari, the
chapel of the public palace was painted, where some historical pieces
representing our Lady, are yet to be seen; and in 1414 he ornamented the
adjoining hall. Besides some pictures from sacred history, he there
formed, as it were, a gallery of illustrious men, chiefly republicans;
and for the edification of the citizens, added some Latin and Italian
verses; a mode of instruction very liberally employed in this school.
The chief merit of the work lies in the dignity and originality of its
invention, which was afterwards imitated in part by Pietro
Perugino,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg
401]</a></span> in the hall of the Exchange, at Perugia. The portraits
are ideal; they are dressed in the costume of Siena, even when they
represent Romans and Grecians, and their attitudes are not happy. His
pictures at Pisa and in Volterra, mentioned by Vasari, still exist; and
that of the Arena in Padua, in the tribune of the church, is well
preserved. In it we discover practical skill, little variety, and less
grace in the heads, feeble tints, and imitations of Giotto, that lose
their value on a comparison with the original. Some of his small
pictures do him greater honour; and in them an imitation of Ambrogio,
his great prototype, is conspicuous, and also the subdued but agreeable
colouring of this school; which, like all the others in Italy, excelled
about this period more in small than in large proportions.</p>

<p>The manner of Taddeo was first pursued and afterwards meliorated, and
greatly aggrandized by Domenico Bartoli, his nephew and disciple.
Foreign connoisseurs behold with delight the various fresco pictures
which he painted in the pilgrim's ward of the hospital, representing the
circumstances of its foundation, and the exercises of christian charity
bestowed upon the sick, the dying, and the indigent. On comparing these,
one with another, the artist displays considerable improvement, and a
greater freedom than usual from the old dryness: his design and
perspective are better, his compositions more scientific; without taking
into account the richness and variety of ideas, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>which he has in common
with the artists of this school. From those pictures Raffaello and
Pinturicchio, while painting at Siena, took many of their notions of
national costume, and, perhaps, of some other particulars: for it is
characteristic of great minds to derive advantage even from examples not
above mediocrity.</p>

<p>Thus the art was gradually advancing in the republic, when new
opportunities were afforded for producing works on a grand scale;
occasions in which genius is developed and invigorated. Siena gave Pius
II. to the chair of S. Peter, who, to the most ardent love of his
country, united a taste for magnificence; and during his residence in
the city, it was embellished with architecture, and every kind of
ornament. He would have been still more profuse, had he not, disgusted
with the ingratitude of the people, turned his attention and beneficence
to Rome. Among other advantages he conferred on the state of Siena, was
that of adding to its territory the city of Corsignano, his native
place; which from him was afterwards called Pienza. The new city
received from him another form, and new edifices, among which was the
cathedral. It was erected in 1462, and for its decoration he invited the
best artists of Siena, Ansano and Lorenzo di Pietro, Giovanni di Paolo,
and Matteo his son. Their style was laborious and minute; the universal
character of that age: for the manner of painting was introduced and
transferred from one country into another, without our<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
being able to discover where it originated; but in the arts depending on
design, as we have before remarked, when the path is once opened, the
natural genius of each school will regulate its further progress. These
four artists are mentioned in the catalogue of Sienese artists; and
Ansano, or Sano, at one time enjoyed the highest reputation. About 1422
he had painted the beautiful fresco which still remains over the Roman
gate; and which represents the Coronation of the Virgin: it is much in
the style of Simone, and in some respects it surpasses him. A picture by
this artist of inferior merit remains in the church of Pienza. Lorenzo
di Pietro, surnamed Il Vecchietta, was eminent in sculpture and in
casting in bronze; and he is noticed by Vasari. He was less successful
in painting, and offends by hardness, as far as we can determine from
the small remains of him in Siena, for there are none existing at
Pienza. A picture of his, with the date 1457, was lately added to the
Medicean gallery. Giovanni di Paolo makes a good figure in Pienza; and a
still better in a Descent from the Cross, painted four years afterwards
in the Osservanza of Siena; in which the defects of the age are
counterbalanced by qualities, at that time by no means common,
displaying a considerable knowledge of the naked figure.</p>

<p>Matteo di Giovanni was then young, but surpassed them all in the
extent of his genius. This is the Matteo denominated by some the
Masaccio of this school, although there is a great distance<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
between him and the Florentine Masaccio. The new style of Matteo begins
to be recognized in one of his two pictures in the cathedral. He
afterwards improved it in his works in the church of S. Domenico, at
Siena, in Madonna della Neve, and in some other churches; and it was he
who first excited the Neapolitan school to attempt a less antiquated
style. Having learnt the process of painting in oil, he imparted
sufficient softness to his figures; and from his intimacy with Francesco
di Giorgio, a celebrated architect,<a name="fnanchor_272"
id="fnanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
he imbibed a good taste in buildings, and diversified them very
ingeniously with alto and <ins title="not hyphenated in the
original">basso-relievos</ins>. He foreshortened level objects well; he
cast draperies with more of nature, and with less frippery than was
common in that age; if he imparted little beauty to the features, he
attained, at least, variety of expression; and was sufficiently
attentive in marking the muscles and veins in his figures. He did not
always aim at novelty and display in his invention; on the contrary,
after painting a Murder of the Innocents, which was his best
composition,<a name="fnanchor_273" id="fnanchor_273"></a><a
href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> he often repeated it in
Siena, and in Naples, but always with improvements: his most<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
studious picture on this subject is that at the Servi of Siena, painted
in 1491, which must have been near the close of his life. He was
accustomed to introduce into his pictures some episode, unconnected with
the principal story, in small figures, a style in which he excelled. The
noble house of Sozzini and some other families in Siena, possess several
of his small pictures. As an artist, he is inferior to Bellini, to
Francia, or Vannucci; but surpasses many others. Another eminent
Sienese, who flourished in the first ages of oil painting, is made known
to us by Ciriaco Anconitano,<a name="fnanchor_274"
id="fnanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
who was acquainted with him in 1449, at the court of Leonello, Marquis
of Este. This artist was named Angelo Parrasio: he painted the nine
muses in the palace of Belfiore, near Ferrara, in imitation of the
manner of Giovanni and Ruggieri da Bruggia.</p>

I conjecture this on the authority of Vasari, who says, that he died in
1345, at the age of 60. In the genuine books at S. Domenico, of Siena,
we find this sentence "Magister Simon Martini pictor mortuus est in
curiâ; cujus exequias fecimus ... 1344." Since Vasari approaches so near
the truth in the time of the painter's death, we may reasonably credit
him also in his age. Mancini says he was born about 1270; which gives
occasion for P. della Valle to mention Simone as a contemporary, and a
competitor of Giotto at Rome. I cannot agree with him on this date, and
the information drawn by him from books belonging to the Sienese
hospital, that Simone was in Siena in 1344, only a few months before his
death, at the court of the Pope at Avignon, strengthens my opinion. I
cannot believe that an old man of seventy-four would transfer his
residence from Siena to Avignon. If we credit Vasari the difficulty
vanishes, inasmuch as Simone, being then scarcely sixty, might be equal
to undertake so long a journey.</p>

There is on it <i>A. D. 1333, Simon Martini et Lippus Memmi de Senis me
pinxerunt</i>. It is now in the ducal gallery at Florence. It may be
remarked on the chronology of this painter, that where we find not Memmi
but only Lippo or Filippo, it does not always seem intended for him.
Thus the M. Filippo, who received a sum of money in 1308, and that
Lippo, who, in 1361, is said to be the assistant of another artist,
(Lett. Sen. tom. ii. p. 110), most probably are not to be identified
with Memmi. He was younger than his relation, and according to Vasari,
survived him 14 years.</p>

<h4 class="p4">SIENESE SCHOOL.</h4>

<h4>EPOCH II.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Foreign Painters at Siena. The origin and
progress of the modern style in that city.</i></div>

<p class="p2">Before this era we have met with no strangers who had
taught painting, or had changed the manner of this school. The art had
there existed for three centuries, always, or almost always,<a
name="fnanchor_275" id="fnanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275"
class="fnanchor">[275]</a> under the guidance of native painters; and it
had even been provided by the statutes of the art, that no foreigner
might be encouraged to practise it at Siena. In one chapter it is
enacted, that "any stranger, wishing to be employed, shall pay a
florin;" and elsewhere, that "he may receive a just and sufficient
recompense to the extent of twenty-five livres." The provision was
subtle: on the one hand they did not, with a marked inhospitality,
positively exclude strangers; but, on the other, they deprived them of
any chance of rivalling the artists of the city in employment at Siena.
Hence it came to pass, according to P. della Valle, that no
pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg
407]</a></span> of other schools, but those of a late period, are to be
found there. But this circumstance, though favourable to the artist,
was, in no small degree, detrimental to the art: for the school of
Siena, by admitting strangers, would have swelled the list of her great
masters; and she might have kept pace with other schools; but this she
neglected, and, after having vied with the Florentine school in
painting, and even surpassed it for some years, towards the close of the
fifteenth century Siena could not, perhaps, boast of a better artist
than Capanna, who executed some façades from the designs of others;<a
name="fnanchor_276" id="fnanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276"
class="fnanchor">[276]</a> or than Andrea del Brescianino, who, in
conjunction with one of his brothers, is said to have painted some
pictures, with which I am unacquainted, in the church of the Olivetine
Friars. They have been more commended by historians than Bernardino
Fungai, an artist whose style was modernized, but dry,<a
name="fnanchor_277" id="fnanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277"
class="fnanchor">[277]</a> than Neroccio, or any other Sienese painter
of that period; but they could not be compared to the best masters of
Italy. The nobility perceived the decline of the native school, and the
necessity of supporting it by the accession of foreign artists; they
wished for such assistance, to the dissatisfaction, probably, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>of
the populace, every where apt to contend that the provender of the land
should rather feed the native beast of burden than the foreign steed.
The Florentine style of painting found its way to Rome; but ancient
rivalry and political jealousy prevented its introduction into Siena.
Perugia seemed a less objectionable ally; and from that place, first
Bonfigli, and afterwards his scholar Pietro Perugino, who executed two
pictures at Siena, were invited; and at length several scholars also of
the latter were called, who long remained in the service of two
celebrated natives of Siena. The one was Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini,
who soon after became Pius III. For the purpose of decorating the
sacristy of the cathedral, and the chapel of his family, with various
pictures from the life of Pius II. he invited Pinturicchio to Siena, and
this artist carried along with him other scholars of Perugino, and even
Raffaello himself, who is reported to have designed either wholly, or in
a great measure, those historical pictures. The other was Pandolfo
Petrucci, who, for some time, usurped the government of the republic:
eagerly desirous of embellishing the palace and some churches, he
availed himself of Signorelli, and of Genga,<a name="fnanchor_278"
id="fnanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
and recalled Pinturicchio.</p>

<p>This passed at the beginning of the sixteenth century; for the
sacristy was completed in 1503; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409"
id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>the return of Pinturicchio took place
in 1508; and, after a short interval, it appears that Genga, the scholar
of Perugino, and Signorelli, came to Siena. From that period, the
Sienese school began to assume the modern style; and design, a full tone
of colouring, and perspective, all attained perfection in a few years.
Had Siena produced a family equal to the Medicean in taste, power, and a
disposition to encourage the fine arts, what might it not have attained!
Siena about this time could boast of four men of talents admirably
adapted to produce a great revolution in the art, and these were
Pacchiarotto, Razzi, Mecherino, and Peruzzi, all of whom (with the
exception of Razzi), Baldinucci, for some reason unknown to me, has
derived from the school of Raffaello. The works of Raffaello, then a
young man, and of other foreign artists, far from repressing their
spirit, awakened in them an honourable emulation. Whoever compares the
pictures of Matteo with their works, would conclude that many years had
intervened; yet they were all living at the death of Matteo. We now come
to the bright era of the school of Siena; and to the consideration of
its most eminent masters.</p>

<p>Jacopo Pacchiarotto<a name="fnanchor_279" id="fnanchor_279"></a><a
href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> followed the manner
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg
410]</a></span> Pietro more closely than any of them, although he was
not his scholar, and, perhaps, had not been out of Siena before 1535. In
that year there happened an insurrection of the people against the
government of that city, in which he was a ringleader, and would have
suffered an ignominious death, had he not been saved by the Osservantine
fathers, who concealed him for some time within a tomb. From thence he
secretly withdrew to France, where he assisted Rosso, and is supposed to
have died. Siena possesses several of his cabinet pictures and
altar-pieces, in the style of Perugino; especially a very beautiful one
in the church of S. Christopher. In his frescos, in the church of S.
Catherine and of S. Bernardino, where he emulated the ablest artists of
Siena, he appears great in composition. The most admired is the copious
picture representing the Visit of the Virgin, S. Catherine, to the body
of S. Agnes of Montepulciano: the others are executed in a similar
taste. He unquestionably appears to have studied Raffaello with the
greatest care; and there are heads and whole figures so lively, and with
such a grace in the features, that, to some connoisseurs, they seem to
possess the ideal beauty of that great artist. Nevertheless,
Pacchiarotto is almost unknown beyond the limits of his native place,
for he is only incidentally mentioned by Vasari; and his works <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>have
passed under the name of Perugino, or of his school.</p>

<p>Giannantonio Razzi, surnamed Il Sodoma, undoubtedly enjoyed the
citizenship of Siena; but it is disputed whether he was born at
Vergelle, a Sienese village, or at Vercelli, in Piedmont. Vasari
expressly states, that he was invited to Siena by some of the noble
family of Spannocchi, and that he was a native of Vercelli; in which
opinion he is supported by Tizio, Giovio, Mancini, and all who wrote
before Ugurgieri. I am confirmed in it by observing his carnations, his
style of chiaroscuro, and other peculiarities of the old school of
Milan, and of Giovenone, who flourished at Vercelli in the early years
of Razzi; and of this style there appears to me traces in the works of
Gio. Antonio; especially in those he executed shortly after he had left
his master. I have not observed the historical pictures of S. Benedict,
which he painted at Monte Oliveto about 1502, and are so ably described
by Sig. Giulio Perini, secretary to the academy of Florence. I have seen
those he executed at Rome in the pontificate of Julius II. He painted
several in the Vatican, that were defaced, because they did not satisfy
the Pope. Raffaello substituted other pictures, but spared the
grotesques. Razzi afterwards executed some pictures from the life of
Alexander the Great, in the Chigi, now the Farnese palace. The nuptials
of Roxana, and the suppliant family of Darius, are the best of them.
They do not exhibit the facility, grace, and dignified<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
heads, that characterize the style of Vinci; but they shew much of his
chiaroscuro, which was then greatly followed by the Lombards:
perspective, their hereditary attribute, is there conspicuous; they
abound in gay images, in little Cupids with their arrows, and a pomp
that is captivating.</p>

<p>His works in Siena, the fruit of his studies in Rome, and of his
mature age, are still superior. The Epiphany, in the church of S.
Augustino, appeared wholly in the style of Vinci to an eminent foreign
connoisseur, who mentioned it to me with rapture. The Flagellation of
Christ, in the cloister of S. Francis, is preferred to the figures of
Michelangiolo by those who are reckoned judges of the art: their
unanimous opinion seems to be that Razzi never produced a finer picture.
Some think as highly of his S. Sebastian, now in the ducal gallery,
which is supposed to have been copied from an antique Torso. The Swoon
of S. Catherine of Siena, which he painted in fresco in a chapel of S.
Domenico, is a picture in the manner of Raffaello. Peruzzi greatly
admired it, and affirmed that he had never seen a swoon so naturally
represented. The air and varied expression in the heads of his picture,
however, are not borrowed from any artist, and on this account he seems
to have extorted the applause even of Vasari. His models, as was usual
with the other artists of this school, were selected from among the
Sienese, whose heads possess a great degree of innate<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
gaiety, openness, and spirit. He painted frequently in a hurried manner,
without any preparatory study; especially in his old age, when reduced
to poverty at Siena, he sought for employment at Pisa, at Volterra, and
at Lucca: but in all his pictures I discover traces of an able artist,
who, though careless of excellence, never painted badly. Vasari, the
great enemy of his fame, who generally styles him Mattaccio,<a
name="fnanchor_280" id="fnanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280"
class="fnanchor">[280]</a> has ascribed to chance, to fortune, or to
fancy, whatever he performed well; as if his usual style had been that
of a bad painter. Here Vasari betrays a want of memory; for he confessed
in the life of Mecherino, that Razzi "possessed the grand principle of
design;" in another passage he has praised the brilliant colouring he
brought with him out of Lombardy; and before noticing the works of his
old age, he has often pronounced the others beautiful, or sometimes
<i>most</i> beautiful and wonderful: hence it may be said of him,
<i>modo ait, modo negat</i>. Guided by public estimation, Giovio has
written of Razzi in a different manner, when speaking of the death of
Raffaello, he subjoins: "plures pari pene gloriâ certantes artem
exceperunt, et in his Sodomas Vercellensis."<a name="fnanchor_281"
id="fnanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
He who objects to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414"
id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>testimony of this eminent scholar, will
receive that of a celebrated painter: Annibale Caracci, passing through
Siena, said, "Razzi appears a very eminent master of the greatest taste,
and (speaking of his best works at Siena) few such pictures are to be
seen."<a name="fnanchor_282" id="fnanchor_282"></a><a
href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>During the many years that Giannantonio lived at Siena, he must have
educated many pupils. A few of them only are noticed by Mancini in one
of his Fragments;<a name="fnanchor_283" id="fnanchor_283"></a><a
href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> and these are Rustico,
the father of Cristofano, an excellent painter of grotesques, with which
he filled Siena; Scalabrino, a man of genius, and a poet;<a
name="fnanchor_284" id="fnanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284"
class="fnanchor">[284]</a> and Michelangiolo Anselmi, or Michelangiol da
Siena, a painter claimed by several places. We shall consider him in the
school of Parma, as he left no work in Siena, except a fresco in the
church of Fonte Giusta, a production of his youth, and not worthy of so
great a name. A scholar of Razzi, then his assistant, and finally his
son-in-law, was Bartolommeo Neroni, otherwise called Maestro Riccio, who
after the death of the four great pillars of the school of Siena,
supported its <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg
415]</a></span>reputation for many years, and probably educated one of
its restorers. He may be recognized at the Osservanti, in a Crucifixion
with three saints standing around, and people in the distance. But his
masterpiece was a Descent from the Cross, much in the manner of Razzi,
at the Derelitte. Some of his other pictures yet remain in the city, in
which he sometimes appears to mingle the style of his father-in-law,
with a certain resemblance to the manner of Vasari, in the distribution
of his tints. He is known to have been very excellent in perspective,
and particularly so in painting scenery; a specimen of which was
engraved by Andreani. He was also greatly skilled in architecture, and
had a pension from the magistrates of Lucca for his assistance in their
public works. Some books include among his disciples Anselmi, who was
rather his kinsman; and Arcangiolo Salimbeni, who finished some of his
works after his death, and on this account only has been supposed his
scholar. From him we shall commence a new epoch in this school.</p>

<p>Domenico Beccafumi derived the surname of Mecherino from a citizen of
Siena, who, having remarked him when a shepherd boy designing something
on a stone, augured favourably of his genius; and obtaining the consent
of his father, brought him to the city, and according to Gigli,
recommended him to Capanna as a scholar. He there employed himself in
copying the designs of eminent artists, and in imitating the pictures of
Pietro Perugino, whose manner he at first adopted; <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>nor
did he ever wholly get rid of it; and his works in the cathedral of Pisa
exhibit a dryness, though they are the productions of his maturer
years.<a name="fnanchor_285" id="fnanchor_285"></a><a
href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Having gone to Rome in
the pontificate of Julius II., a new scene was opened to him in the
specimens of ancient sculpture, of which he was a most sedulous
designer, and in the pictures in which Michelangiolo and Raffaello had
assayed their skill. After two years he returned home, and there
continuing his close attention to design, he found himself strong enough
to contend with Razzi; and, if we may credit Vasari, even to surpass
him. He had acquired skill in perspective, and was fertile in invention
as a painter. In Siena, Mecherino is ranked after Razzi; and the many
places where they vied with each other, facilitates the comparison to
those who are disposed to make it. At first he humoured his placid
disposition by painting in a sweet style; at that time he made choice of
beautiful airs for his heads; and very frequently inserted the portrait
of his mistress in his pictures. In this style is his fine picture at
the church of the Olivetines of S. Benedict; in which he has represented
the titular saint, with S. Jerome, and the Virgin S. Catherine, and
where he has added some circumstances of her life in small figures. The
last annotator on Vasari prefers this work to many<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
other pictures of Mecherino, and laments, that, captivated by the energy
of Bonarruoti, he had deviated from his original manner. And, indeed,
when he aspired to more vigour he frequently appears coarse in his
proportions, negligent in his extremities, and harsh in his heads. This
defect so increased in his old age that his heads of that period
appeared without beauty even to Vasari.</p>

<p>His mode of colouring is not the most true; for it was mannered with
a reddish hue, which is, however, fascinating and cheerful to the eye;
it is neat, clear, and of such a body that it remains on walls at this
day, in the highest preservation. A few of his works remain in Genoa,
where he painted the palace of Prince Doria; they are not numerous at
Pisa; but they abound in his native place, both in public and in
private. His merit was greater in distemper than in oil colouring; and
his historical frescos do him greater honour than his other paintings.
His skill was great in distributing them to suit the place, and in
adapting them to the architecture; he ornamented them with grotesque
decorations in such a manner that he required not the aid of gilt
stucco, or other gaudy trappings. These inventions have such felicity,
that a single glance recals the story to the memory of one acquainted
with its circumstances. He treats his subject copiously, with dignity,
and with perfect nature: he imparts grandeur to it by his architectural
views, and elegance by introducing the usages of antiquity. He
peculiarly delighted in the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418"
id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span> recondite principles of the art, which
were then less generally employed; as peculiar reflections of fires and
other lights; difficult foreshortenings, especially as applied to
ceilings, which were then very rare in lower Italy. Vasari has minutely
described his figure of Justice; the feet of which are in dark shadow,
gradually diminishing to the shoulders, which are invested with a most
brilliant celestial light: "Nor is it possible," says he, "to imagine,
much less to find, a more beautiful figure ... amongst all that ever
were painted to appear foreshortened when viewed from below." According
to this verdict, Mecherino deserves the appellation of the Coreggio of
lower Italy, in this very difficult branch of painting; for no modern
artist had attempted so much before his time. The above<ins title="one
word in the original"> </ins>mentioned figure is painted on the vaulted
ceiling of the consistory of the government; and the artist has arranged
below it various oval and square pictures, each representing some
memorable exploit of a republican hero. He pursued the same idea in an
apartment in the mansion now in possession of the Bindi family, which P.
della Valle reckons his masterpiece. The figures resemble those in the
<i>Logge</i> of Raffaello: they are better coloured than those in the
consistory, and being smaller are, on that account, better designed: for
the style of Mecherino resembles a liquor which retains its qualities
when shut up in a phial, but evaporates and is dissipated when poured
into a larger vessel. This circumstance, however, was common to many
others: his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg
419]</a></span>peculiarity consists in what he communicated to Vasari;
that, "out of the atmosphere of Siena, he imagined he could not paint
successfully;" an effect, according to P. Guglielmo, of the climate;
which would be a happy secret for peopling it with painters. Perhaps it
is to be explained by the greater degree of quiet and tranquillity that
he enjoyed at home, in the society of his friends, among a people ready
to encourage him by praise, not to chill him by reproach, and surrounded
by all the spectacles and the lively genius of his country; objects
eagerly desired by the natives of Siena, but not easily found in other
places.</p>

<p>The style of Mecherino, now described, expired with him: for his
pupil, Giorgio da Siena, became a painter of grotesques, and imitated
Gio. da Udine, both in his own country and at Rome: Giannella, or Gio.
da Siena, turned his attention from painting to architecture; and Marco
da Pino, surnamed also da Siena, united a variety of styles. Baglione,
and the historians of Siena, say, that he was there educated by
Beccafumi, and Baldinucci adds, likewise by Peruzzi: P. della Valle,
from his brilliant colouring, denies him to them, and assigns him to
Razzi. All, however, are agreed that he obtained his knowledge
principally from Rome, where he first painted from the cartoons of
Ricciarelli or of Perino; and if we may credit Lomazzo, was also
instructed by Bonarruoti. We cannot readily find any Florentine capable
of following the precepts of Michelangiolo, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>without ostentation;
but he acquired the principles without the affectation of displaying his
knowledge. His manner is grand, select, and full of elegance: it is
adduced by Lomazzo as a perfect model for the human figure, and for the
just distribution of the light according to the distance of objects; a
department of the art in which he shares the glory with Vinci,
Tintoretto, and Baroccio. He painted little in Siena except a picture,
with which I am not acquainted, in the mansion of the Francesconi
family; and few of his works are to be seen at Rome, with the exception
of a Pietà, in an altar of Araceli, and some frescos in the church Del
Gonfalone. Naples was his field; and there he will again appear as a
master and historian of that school.</p>

<p>If conjecture were allowable in assigning masters to painters of the
old schools, I should be inclined to reckon Daniele di Volterra rather
the scholar of Mecherino, than of Razzi or Peruzzi. We know for certain
that he studied at Siena in early life, when those three artists kept an
open academy. Peruzzi was wholly a follower of Raffaello; Razzi disliked
the Florentine style; and Beccafumi alone aspired to be esteemed a
faithful imitator of Bonarruoti: by regarding him, therefore, as the
master of Daniele, we can best account for the already noticed
predilection of the latter for the style of Michelangiolo. No artist was
capable of initiating him better in the art of casting in bronze than
Mecherino; or afford him more frequent examples of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
that strong opposition of bright and sombre colours that appears in some
works of Daniele. Yet I will not depart from the more correct rule which
forbids us in such doubtful points to depart readily from history: for
each painter was always free to choose his style; he might be directed
in one path by his master, and drawn a different way by his own genius,
or by accidental circumstances.</p>

<p>Baldassare Peruzzi is one of the numerous individuals whose merit
must not be measured by their good fortune. Born in indigent
circumstances in the diocese of Volterra, but within the territory of
Siena, and of a Sienese father,<a name="fnanchor_286"
id="fnanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
he was nurtured amid difficulties, and through life was the perpetual
sport of misfortune. Reckoned inferior to his rivals, because he was as
modest and timid as they were arrogant and impudent; despoiled of his
whole property in the sack of Rome; constrained to exist on a mere
pittance at Siena, at Bologna, or at Rome,<a name="fnanchor_287"
id="fnanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
he died when he began to be known, not without suspicion of being
poisoned, and with the affliction of leaving a wife and six children
almost beggars. His death demonstrated to the world better than his life
the greatness of his genius; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422"
id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>and the justness of his epitaph, in
which he is compared to the ancients, is allowed by posterity. General
consent ranks him among the best architects of his age; and he would
also have been classed with the greatest painters, had he coloured as
well as he designed, and had always been equal to himself; a thing he
could not command during a life so chequered and wretched.</p>

<p>After Peruzzi had received the elements of the art in his native
place from an unknown master, he went to Rome for the completion of his
studies, in the time of Alexander VI. He knew, admired, and imitated
Raffaello (of whom some suppose him a pupil), especially his Holy
Families.<a name="fnanchor_288" id="fnanchor_288"></a><a
href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> He approached him nearly
in some works in fresco; such as the Judgment of Paris in the castle of
Belcaro, which is deemed his best performance, and the celebrated Sybil
foretelling the birth of Christ to Augustus, in the Fonte Giusta, of
Siena, which is admired as one of the finest pictures in that city. He
imparted to it such a divine enthusiasm, that Raffaello himself never
surpassed him in treating <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423"
id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>this subject; nor Guido, nor Guercino,
of whom so many Sybils are exhibited. In great compositions, such as the
Presentation in the Pace at Rome,<a name="fnanchor_289"
id="fnanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
he designs well, gives a faithful representation of the passions, and
embellishes the subject by appropriate edifices. His oil paintings are
very rare; those representing the Magi, which are shewn in many
collections at Florence, Parma, and Bologna, are copies from one of his
chiaroscuros, which was afterwards coloured by Girolamo da Trevigi, as
we are informed by Vasari. I was told at Bologna, that the picture of
Girolamo was lost at sea, and that the picture which the Rizzardi family
of that place possess, is a copy by Cesi. His small altar-pieces are
uncommonly scarce likewise: and I am unable to point out any of them but
one, which contains three half-length figures of the Virgin, the
Baptist, and S. Jerome, and is at Torre Babbiana, eighteen miles from
Siena.</p>

<p>What I have here related would have added to the glory of any other
artist; but is little to the merit of Baldassare. The genius of this man
was not limited to the production of excellent cabinet pictures and
frescos. I have already said he was an architect; or, as Lomazzo has
expressed it, a universal architect: and in this profession, the fruit
of his assiduous study of ancient edifices, he ranks among the foremost,
and is even preferred to Bramante. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>The encomiums bestowed
on him by the most celebrated writers on architecture are mentioned in
the third volume of the Sienese Letters.<a name="fnanchor_290"
id="fnanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
No one, however, has done him greater honour than his scholar Serlio,
who declares in the introduction to his fourth book, that, whatever
merit his work possesses, is not due to himself, but to Baldassare da
Siena, of whose manuscripts he became the heir, and the plagiarist, if
we are to credit Giulio Piccolomini,<a name="fnanchor_291"
id="fnanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
and his other townsmen. The declaration above stated absolves Serlio
from this imputation, unless it is insisted that he ought to have
affixed the name of Baldassare to every anecdote that he learnt or took
from those manuscripts; a thing which it would be unreasonable to
demand. He has, indeed, frequently mentioned him, and commended him for
a sound taste, for facility, and elegance, both in designing edifices,
and in ornamenting them. To say the truth, his peculiar merit lies in
giving a pleasing effect to his works; and I have not observed any idea
of his which in some way does not exhibit the stamp of a lively
imagination. This character is apparent in the portico of the Massimi at
Rome, the great altar of the metropolitan church of Siena, and the large
gateway of the Sacrati palace at Ferrara, which is so finely ornamented
that it is named among the rarities of that city, and, in its kind, even
of Italy. But what chiefly establishes his reputation as a man of
excellent and various genius, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425"
id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>is the Farnese palace, which is
"executed with such exquisite grace that it appears created by
enchantment, rather than built by human hands."<a name="fnanchor_292"
id="fnanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292"
class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>He was eminently skilled in ornamenting façades; in painting so as to
represent real architecture, and basso-<ins title="'rilievos' in the
original">relievos</ins> of sacrifices, Bacchanalian scenes, and
battles, which "serve to maintain the buildings sound and in good order,
while they improve their appearance," according to Serlio.<a
name="fnanchor_293" id="fnanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293"
class="fnanchor">[293]</a> He left fine specimens of this art at Siena
and in Rome, where he was followed by Polidoro, who carried it to the
summit of perfection. Peruzzi practised it at the Farnese palace in
those pictures in green earth, with which he covered the outside, and
still more in the internal decorations. Not to mention F. Sebastiano,
Raffaello himself was employed in the same place: and in one apartment,
finished without assistance, the celebrated Galatea. Baldassare painted
the ceiling and the corbels with some fables of Perseus, and other
heroes: the style is light, spirited, and resembles that of Raffaello,
but is unequal to that of his model. Though inferior in figures he was
not behind in some other branches. His imitation of stucco ornaments
appears so relieved that even Titian was deceived by it, and found it
necessary to change his point of view before he could be convinced of
his error. A similar ocular deception is produced by the hall where a
colonnade <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg
426]</a></span>is represented, the intercolumniations of which make it
appear much larger than it really is. This work induced Pietro Aretino
to say, that the palace "contained no picture more perfect in its
kind."<a name="fnanchor_294" id="fnanchor_294"></a><a
href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> And if the scenes which
he painted for the plays, represented in the Apostolical palace for the
amusement of Leo X. had survived to our days, the perspective paintings
of Peruzzi would have obtained greater fame than the Calandra of Card.
da Bibbiena; and it would have been said of him, as of the ancient, that
he discovered a new art, and brought it to perfection. The observation
of Vasari, Lomazzo, and other old writers, that Peruzzi was not to be
surpassed in perspective, has been recently confirmed by Sig. Milizia in
the Memoirs of Architects. In this art he appears to me to have given
the first and most classic examples. When I have occasion hereafter to
notice celebrated perspectives in Rome, in Venice, or Bologna, we must
recollect, that if others surpassed him in the vastness of their works,
they never did so in their perfection. Maestro Riccio is praised in
Siena as second to him in perspective, and was his scholar for some
time; but afterwards he imitated the figures of his father-in-law.</p>

<p>The merit of Baldassare in grotesque is better seen at Siena than in
Rome. This sort of painting, always the offspring of a whimsical fancy,
was congenial to Mecherino and to Razzi; and both practised it with
success. The latter seemed born to conceive and to execute it with
unpremeditated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427"
id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>facility; he painted in this style in
the Vatican, and obtained the approbation of Raffaello, who was
unwilling to cancel his grotesques as he did his historical
compositions: he also executed some at Monte Oliveto that are highly
facetious, and may be called an image of his own brain. Cristoforo
Rustici and Giorgio da Siena obtained great fame in this style; but none
of them equalled Peruzzi. This artist, graceful in all his works, was
most elegant in grotesque; and amid the freedom that a subject wholly
capricious inspires, he preserved an art which Lomazzo has studied, in
order to comprehend its principles. He employs every species of idea;
satyrs, masks, children, animals, monsters, edifices, trees, flowers,
vases, candelabra, lamps, armour, and thunderbolts; but in their
arrangement, in the actions represented, and in every other
circumstance, he bridled his caprice by his judgment. He distorts and
connects those images with a surprising symmetry, and adapts them as
devices emblematic of the stories which they surround. This man, living
in the brightest period of modern art, is in short, one of the
individuals most interesting in its history. He had many pupils in
architecture, but few in painting: among the latter are a Francesco
Senese, and a Virgilio Romano, who are commended by Vasari for their
frescos, and to whom grotesques, of uncertain origin, are sometimes
attributed in Siena.</p>

<p>Somewhat later, but certainly before the complete revival of the art
at Siena, I am disposed to class a fresco painter, whom Baglione and
Titi call <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg
428]</a></span>Matteo da Siena; but who is named Matteino in his native
place, that he may not be confounded with the Matteo of the fourteenth
century. He lived at Rome in the time of Niccolò Circignani, in whose
pictures, and in those of artists of the same class, he inserted
perspectives and landscapes. The efforts of his pencil may be seen at S.
Stefano Rotondo, in thirty-two historical pictures of martyrs painted by
Circignani, which have been engraved by Cavalieri. Many of his
landscapes are in the Vatican gallery, which are beautiful, although in
the old style. At the age of fifty-five he died at Rome, where he was
established in the pontificate of Sixtus V. These circumstances make it
appear to me unlikely, that he had painted in the Casino of Siena, about
1551, or in the Lucarini palace, along with Rustichino: the first period
I consider too early, and the latter too late.</p>

<p>I shall now give some account of the chiaroscuros executed in mosaic,
which owe their perfection to the school of Siena, during the epoch of
which we are about to finish our account. I have already mentioned the
erection of the magnificent cathedral of Siena, a work of many years;
and may now add, that though it was grand in all its parts, nothing
shewed such originality, or was so generally admired as the pavement
around the great altar, all storied with subjects taken from the New
Testament, of which the figures were surrounded by appropriate
ornaments, which served to vary and divide the immense ground of the
painting. A succession of artists always labouring<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span> to
improve this work, carried it in a few years to an astonishing pitch of
excellence. The nature of the stone quarries in the Sienese territory,
afforded also facilities to the art which could not be so easily
attained in other places. It originated like other arts from small and
rude beginnings. Duccio commenced this ornamented pavement. The part
which he executed is constructed of stones, in which the limbs and
contours of the figures are scooped out: it is a dry but not ungraceful
production of the thirteenth century. The young woman in the choir who
kneels with her arms leaning on a cross, and, as an inscription informs
us, implores the mercy of the Lord, is the work of Duccio: it probably
represents Christian piety; and certainly both the attitude and the
countenance are expressive of what she asks. Those who continued the
pavement immediately after Duccio, are not so well known. We read of an
Urbano da Cortona, and an Antonio Federighi, who designed and executed
the two Sybils; the rest was in like manner the work of artists of
little note. They all, however, improved the art in some degree, cutting
the figures with the chisel, and filling up what was removed by the
iron, with pitch or some black composition; and this was a rude sort of
chiaroscuro. To them succeeded Matteo di Giovanni, who, from an
attentive consideration of what his predecessors had done, fell on a
method of surpassing them. He remarked a vein of the marble in the
drapery of a figure of David, which formed a very natural fold, and
by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg
430]</a></span> the contrast of the colours made the knee and leg appear
in relief: in like manner he discovered in a figure of Solomon a shade
of colour in the marble, well suited to produce effect. He then selected
marbles of different colours; and joining them after the manner of an
inlaying with stained wood, produced a work that was entitled to the
name of a marble chiaroscuro. In this manner he executed without
assistance a Slaughter of the Innocents, a composition which he
frequently repeated, as we before remarked. He thus opened the path for
Beccafumi's histories, who wrought in a superior style a large part of
that pavement, which his exertions, says Vasari, rendered "the most
beautiful, the largest, and most magnificent that was ever executed."
This work employed his leisure hours till he attained to old age; and
though painting interrupted his labours, he did not abandon it until his
death, and hence, some of the historical compositions were completed by
other hands, as is supposed from his cartoons. He executed the Sacrifice
of Isaac, in figures as large as life; and Moses striking the Rock, with
a crowd of Hebrews rushing to catch the water, and slake their thirst;
besides several other subjects, which are described by Vasari; and more
minutely by Landi.<a name="fnanchor_295" id="fnanchor_295"></a><a
href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> I shall<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
subjoin a few observations on the mechanism of the art. The first
attempt of Beccafumi was to compose a picture of inlaid wood, which was
long preserved in the studio of Vanni, and afterwards was in the
possession of the Counts of the Delci family. He represented the
Conversion of S. Paul in this piece, by employing wood of the colours
only that were necessary to produce a chiaroscuro. After this model he
selected white marble for the light parts of his figures, and the very
purest for the catching lights; grey marble for the middle tints, black
for the shadows, and for the darkest lines he sometimes employed a black
stucco. He cut the pieces of these marbles, which are all indigenous,
and inlaid them so nicely that the joinings are not easily discernible.
This has induced some to believe that white marble is alone employed in
this pavement, and that the middle tints and shadows are formed by
certain very penetrating colours, capable of softening the marble and of
colouring it throughout. We learn from a letter of Gallaccini, that this
idea was adopted by some natives of Siena, and it appears from another
of Mariette, that this great connoisseur was impressed with it, and
gained over Bottari to his opinion.<a name="fnanchor_296"
id="fnanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
Inspection overturns this supposition, for we may discover the seams
between the different colours; and this circumstance induces the author
of the Sienese Letters and the best informed persons, to disbelieve<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span> the
artificial colouring of the marble. The truth is, the secret of
colouring marble was not then known, but was afterwards discovered in
Siena by Michelangiolo Vanni, who has transmitted the memory of his
invention to posterity.<a name="fnanchor_297" id="fnanchor_297"></a><a
href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> He erected a monument
for his father, Cav. Francesco, with columns, ornaments, festoons, and
figures of children; accompanied by a genealogy of the family, which
were all designed on a white slab, and every part carefully and
appropriately coloured, so as to resemble mosaic of different marbles.
It is supposed that the colours were imparted to the marble by some
mineral essences to impregnate it, because they penetrated a
considerable way. He entitles himself the inventor of this art, in the
monumental inscription. A secret of this nature was known to Niccolò
Tornioli, of Siena, about the year 1640; and this artist is said to have
painted a Veronica in that manner, the marble of which he caused to be
sawed, and the same picture was found on each side of the section.<a
name="fnanchor_298" id="fnanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298"
class="fnanchor">[298]</a> He was probably a scholar of Vanni; and the
latter seems anxious by the inscription that he should not claim the
honour of the invention. The connexion of the subject has led me to
notice these two artists in this place. Their true place is in the third
epoch of the Sienese school, to which I shall immediately proceed.</p>

He is thus named by Baldinucci; but Vasari, in his Life of Razzi,
mentions a Girolamo del Pacchia, a rival of Razzi himself; and this
person appears to be Pacchiarotto. He also mentions Giomo, or Girolamo
del Sodoma, who died young; and whom both Orlandi and Bottari have
confounded with Pacchiarotto; when we ought rather to believe that he
was a pupil of Razzi, and died while he was yet young.</p>

For his labours in the cathedral of Siena he had thirty crowns a year;

of his modesty, in either not paying him at all, or rewarding him
scantily.</p>

I saw one in the possession of Cav. Cavaceppi in Rome, of which this
great connoisseur used to say, that it might pass for a Raffaello, if it
had been as like in colouring as in every thing else. The Sergardi
family at Siena have another, and a Holy Family, by Razzi, as its
companion. These are reckoned among their first performances, and are
believed to have been painted in competition with each other. In that of
Peruzzi one recognizes, even at that time, that elegance of design which
he delighted afterwards to exhibit in his figures, especially in the
Chigi, now called the Farnese palace.</p>

<h4 class="p4">SIENESE SCHOOL.</h4>

<h4>EPOCH III.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><i>The art having declined in Siena through the
disasters of the state, is revived by the labours of Salimbeni and his
sons.</i></div>

<p class="p2">We have related the progress and best works of the Sienese
school from the beginning, to about the middle of the sixteenth century;
but we have not yet considered a circumstance that adds greatly to the
merit of the artists and works of that period. If we search into the
history of that half century, we shall find that all Italy groaned under
the pressure of public calamities; but Siena, to a greater degree, and
for a longer period than any other place, endured an accumulation of the
most terrible evils. Famine, pestilence, and a suspension of commercial
intercourse, afflicted other states, but here they seem to have
exhausted their rage: civil commotions and external enemies agitated
other states, but here, during a period of many years, they allowed not
a moment of tranquillity. The republic of Siena, strong in the valour of
her citizens, was feeble in every thing besides; and hence it resembled
a gulph, where tempests are more frequent and more violent than on the
ocean. The usurpation <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434"
id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>of the Petrucci, the dissensions
between the nobles and the people, and jealousy of foreign powers, who
sought her subjugation, kept Siena in constant alarm, and often incited
to arms and to bloodshed. The remedy which they now expected in the
protection of the emperor, at another time from France, only served to
aggravate internal commotion and foreign aggression. Amid this perpetual
agitation, I know not whether most to admire the genius of the people,
ever directed to the decoration of their houses and public edifices, or
the spirit of the artists, who could summon all the powers of their
minds to such efforts: this I know, that similar instances are rare in
other countries. The year 1555 at length arrived, when Cosmo I. deprived
the Sienese of their long defended liberty. To any enemy but the
Florentines they would have submitted with less reluctance; and on this
account our astonishment is lessened on finding that, on this occasion,
two thirds of the inhabitants abandoned their native soil, refusing to
live subject to enemies so abhorred.</p>

<p>At this time, and in the disasters above alluded to, the city lost
many able artists, and also several families, from whom eminent artists
were descended, and whose Sienese origin is confirmed by history.
Baglione says of Camillo Mariani, that he was born at Vicenza, and that
his father was a native of Siena, who had expatriated himself on account
of the wars; and he praises the cabinet pictures of this artist, who
died at Rome with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435"
id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>reputation of an excellent sculptor. I
likewise find at Bologna an Agostino Marcucci, of Siena, who is wholly
unknown in that place, probably because he was the son of an emigrant.
He was a disciple of the Caracci, till a schism arose in that school,
which we shall notice in its proper place, when he ranged himself with
the foremost adherents of Facini, the leader of the party, and they had
the boldness to set up a new academy in opposition to that of the
Caracci. He continued to reside in Bologna, and to teach to the time of
his death, and is reckoned by Malvasia among "the first men" of that
age. Of his scholars Malvasia mentions only Ruggieri, and he only
notices one of his pictures at the Concezione;<a name="fnanchor_299"
id="fnanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
to which several others, however, are added in the New Guide.</p>

<p>Siena, in the mean time, began to breathe from her misfortunes, and
to be reconciled to the new government, which, through the prudence of
Cosmo, appeared rather a reformation in the old, than a new domination.
No long time elapsed before the void left in the city by the artists who
had emigrated was filled up by others. Rustico had remained there, as
well as his superior, Riccio, who painted the celebrated scene, already
noticed, on the coming of Cosmo. Siena also possessed Tozzo and Bigio,
whom Lancillotti reckons "among the most famous painters," I believe, in
small figures; and it is not easy to distinguish between those two
artists, who had an extraordinary similarity of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>style. Arcangiolo
Salimbeni, who is expressly said by Baldinucci to be a "scholar of
Federigo Zuccari," may have received the rudiments of the art from one
of them. Perhaps, as the historian goes on to say, during his residence
at Rome he might contract an intimate friendship with Zuccari; but the
style of Salimbeni discovers very opposite principles from those of that
master; and notwithstanding all researches, no one has succeeded in
finding pictures of his that bear indications of that school. He loved
precision more than fulness of design; and we may even observe in him an
attachment to the manner of Pietro Perugino, as was observed by Della
Valle with regard to a Crucifixion attended by six Saints, in the parish
church of Lusignano. In his other pictures at Siena, especially in the
S. Peter-Martyr, in possession of the Dominicans, he appears wholly
modern;<a name="fnanchor_300" id="fnanchor_300"></a><a
href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> but diligent, and free
from the defects which we often observe in Federigo, who may be
considered as a professed mannerist of that period. It was the good
fortune of the Sienese school, that Riccio was succeeded by this artist,
who, if he had not a lofty genius, possessed, at least, the judgment to
avoid the faults of his contemporaries. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>Hence, amid the
degeneracy of the neighbouring schools this remained uncontaminated, or
but slightly infected; and the new disciples it sent forth contributed
to the improvement of the art in Italy. They were not so much attached
to home as Mecherino; they painted equally well beyond the territory of
Siena; they visited very distant cities, and in them all left specimens
of their art, both in public and in private, which are still preserved.
After receiving the first instruction from Salimbeni, or some less known
artist, each chose his own guide. We shall here proceed with their
history.</p>

<p>After receiving the rudiments of the art at Siena, Pietro Sorri went
to Florence, under Passignano, and became his son-in-law, and the
associate of his labours in that place and in Venice. He emulated the
style of Passignano, which partook, as we have observed, of the
Florentine and the Venetian: he succeeded so well, that their works bear
a perfect resemblance, and are held in equal estimation. He painted less
expeditiously than his father-in-law; but his colouring was more
durable, and, if I mistake not, his design more graceful. The convent of
S. Sebastian, which was ornamented by a competition of the best Sienese
artists of this epoch, has one of his pictures, which are rather
uncommon in Siena; for his best years were spent in other places. He was
much at Florence: and afterwards visited many other Tuscan cities; and
there is scarcely any considerable place among them which<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
cannot boast the efforts of his easy and graceful pencil; but
particularly Pisa, the cathedral of which could not but attract such an
artist. He there represented the Consecration of that church on one
large canvas, and, on another, Christ disputing with the Doctors, which
is inscribed with his name: and never did he approach nearer to the
excellence of Paul Veronese in architecture and other accompaniments. He
was employed in the Carthusian monastery of Pavia, and also in Genoa,
where we shall find him as a preceptor in that school.</p>

<p>Casolani took his surname from Casole, the little town from which his
family removed to Siena. In the ducal gallery of Florence there is a
portrait of a lady with three men, in the same piece, which is said to
represent Lucrezia Piccolomini, with her three sons, Alessandro
Casolani, Francesco Vanni, and Ventura Salimbeni, whom she bore to
different husbands, in the course of a few years. This makes Alessandro
the stepson of Arcangiolo Salimbeni, and the uterine brother of Ventura
and of Vanni. I cannot find this story in any author, except in Niccolò
Pio, a Roman writer of no authority, whose manuscript, containing
notices of two hundred and fifty artists, which was drawn up about 1724,
is preserved in the Vatican library.<a name="fnanchor_301"
id="fnanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
The old writers of Siena have taken no notice of so remarkable an event,
and we cannot, therefore, give <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439"
id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>credit to Pio, a stranger, and a modern
author. The relation then in which Alessandro stands to Arcangiolo is
that of scholar; but he learnt more from Cav. Roncalli in Siena and in
Rome. He remained long in the latter city: he designed the finest works
it contained, and obtained some idea of different styles. This knowledge
was increased by a journey which he made some years afterwards to Pavia,
where he painted in the Carthusian monastery, and in other places. His
manner is prodigiously varied. It exhibits traces of the best style of
Roncalli, a good design, sobriety of composition, a modesty of
colouring, and tranquil harmony. He seems also to have aimed at
originality, for he was continually altering his style, mingling it with
the graces of various artists, and sometimes striking out into a novel
path. He possessed promptness of genius and of execution: he was quick
in committing his ideas to the canvas; and when dissatisfied with his
work, he often chose to cancel the whole, rather than to correct a part.
Although unacquainted with ideal beauty, he was esteemed by Guido, who
may be considered as the father of modern painters, and who said of him
"this truly is a painter." Whoever would see his best work, may examine
the martyrdom of S. Bartholomew, at the Carmine of Siena. It is a
picture of considerable size, with great variety in the figures and in
the expression, and altogether excites surprise. We are told that when
Roncalli examined it, he at length exclaimed, that the art of that
period was comprised in that picture. But the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>short life of Casolani
prevented him attaining the excellence which this specimen promised. His
works are in various cities of Tuscany, and also in Naples, Genoa, and
Fermo, in the metropolitan church of which there is a picture of S.
Louis of France, that is numbered among the choice paintings in that
city.</p>

<p>A good many of his works in Siena shew traces of, and even whole
figures by other hands; having been finished by Vanni, and Ventura
Salimbeni, or by other artists, either of his own or of different
schools. Ilario Casolani, his son, by a daughter of Rustici, finished
the Assumption for the Church of S. Francis; and afterwards went to
Rome, where he was "noticed by Cav. Pomaranci, out of respect to his
father," says Mancini, as of a thing he knew, and adds, that Pomaranci
had good hopes of him. Baglione and Pio called him Cristoforo, a name
he, perhaps, received along with several others at baptism; and which
probably the Sienese artist thought more becoming at Rome than Ilario,
since he is named Cristoforo, by Roncalli. Under Pomaranci he became a
proficient in his style in fresco, and imitated it particularly at
Madonna de' Monti, in some pictures from the history of the Virgin, and
in an Ascension on the ceiling; the best work, perhaps, produced in the
short course of his life. Titi uniformly names him Cristoforo Consolano;
but a consideration of the anecdotes of Mancini and Baglione leads us to
convert it into Casolano. A Resurrection of Lazarus, begun by Alessandro
for the church of S. Francis, was finished <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>by Vincenzio Rustici;
who was probably his scholar and his kinsman, and who is the least
celebrated among this family of painters. One of his pictures, intended
for Santuccio, was finished by Sebastiano Folli. The frescos of this
artist are more numerous at Siena than his oil pictures: the ornamental
parts of them are superior to his figures, in which he inclined to
mannerism; his compartments are beautiful, his architecture finely
conducted, his imitations of stucco deceive the eye, and he was expert
in foreshortening what was to be seen from below. In 1608 he painted the
frescos of S. Sebastian, in competition with various artists, and in
this trial of skill he only yields to Rutilio Manetti. In the Guide of
the Cav. Pecci I find mention made of designs of Casolani, executed in
fresco by Stefano Volpi, whose name not unfrequently occurs in that
work, and who was probably a scholar of that excellent artist.</p>

<p>Cav. Ventura, the son of A. Salimbeni, is reckoned the third scholar
of that master, though his lessons from Arcangiolo must have been but
few. The young man left his home early, and journeying through the
cities of Lombardy, he studied the works of Correggio and others, whose
taste began to be applauded in Tuscany. He went to Rome in the
pontificate of Sixtus V. and raised a very favourable opinion of his
genius, which, giving himself up to dissipation, he did not afterwards
fulfil. In that city he left many frescos that are praised by Baglione,
among which, the Abraham entertaining the Angels, in a chapel of the
Gesù, appears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg
442]</a></span> on the whole, the work of a consummate painter. It has
something lively and graceful in the colouring and the countenances,
which he always retained: it also shews attention to design and
chiaroscuro, which, in a great measure, he afterwards neglected in his
paintings. In conjunction with Vanni he executed some ceilings, and,
perhaps, derived advantage from observing this painter, though his
junior by eight years. In many of his works he undoubtedly resembles him
in his imitation of Baroccio, and hardly yields to him in grace of
contour, in expression, and in delicacy and clearness of colouring. He
is admired in the church of S. Quirico, and in that of S. Domenick: in
the one is his Appearance of the Angel at the Sepulchre; in the other a
Crucifixion, with various Saints around, which are superior to the
generality of his works. In several other places in Siena there are
others of great merit, especially where he painted in the vicinity of
the works of the best masters of his school. He likewise executed some
beautiful historical pieces when he vied with Poccetti, in the cloister
of the Servi at Florence, and in the cathedral of Pisa, where he was
surrounded by such great painters. His Marriage of the Virgin, in the
cathedral of Foligno, his S. Gregory, in the church of S. Peter at
Perugia, his works in Lucca, in Pavia, and in various cities of Italy,
justify the remark of Baglione, that Salimbeni was impatient of
remaining long in any one place. In Genoa, however, his stay was not so
short. The beautiful chamber in the Adorno palace, and other<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
works which he there executed, are still in existence, while many others
have perished. He went to Genoa at the same time with Agostino Tassi,
who served him for an ornamental and landscape painter, and, perhaps, it
was through him that Ottavio Ghissoni, of Siena, came to that place; an
artist, if I am not mistaken, forgotten in the annals of his own
country; in fresco he was more lively than correct. He studied at Rome
under Cherubino Alberti; but his country, his style, and the time of his
arrival at Genoa, afford ground to suspect that he had also received the
lessons of Salimbeni. Soprani gives Ventura the surname of Bevilacqua,
which is rather an addition to his name granted him by Cardinal
Bevilacqua when he knighted him in Perugia.</p>

<p>Cav. Francesco Vanni, in the opinion of many, is the best painter of
this school; and is reckoned one of the restorers of Italian painting in
the sixteenth century. The early instruction of his genius is to be
assigned with greater probability to his brother than to his stepfather.
At sixteen years of age he went to Rome, for the purpose of designing
after Raffaello and the best masters. He was for some time under the
tuition of Gio. de' Vecchi, whose style he introduced into his native
country. There are specimens of him in many churches, and it is related
that they were not relished by his fellow citizens; a circumstance which
might occasion him uneasiness at the time, but soon after afforded him a
lasting source of satisfaction. It induced him to examine the pictures
of Lombardy, as his brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444"
id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span> had done: and having remained in Parma
to design some of them, he afterwards went to Bologna, where he was
assiduously occupied. Ugurgieri writes that he was at that place in
1667, at which time he was twelve years old: this I believe to be
incorrect; for it was unknown to Mancini, who was acquainted with Vanni.
Malvasia repeats it on the authority of Ugurgieri; but he can discover
nothing further of Vanni, at Bologna, than his being there after he had
arrived at manhood, and designing in the academy of Facini and
Mirandola, to which he was probably introduced by his countryman
Marcucci. He left some works at Bologna, in the style of the Caracci, if
he is the painter of a Madonna, which was shewn me as a Vanni, in a
cabinet of the Zambeccari collection. His Flight into Egypt, painted for
the church of S. Quirico, in Siena, bears also undoubted marks of the
Bolognese school.</p>

<p>Although he attempted other styles, he was not like Casolani an
adherent to none. Vanni attached himself to the elegant and florid
manner of Barocci, in which he was eminently successful. Of this, the
Humiliation of Simon the Sorcerer, which he painted on a stone slab for
the church of S. Peter at Rome, affords a proof; a picture which, though
recently cleaned with little judgment, is still an object of admiration.
Both the design and colouring are in the manner of Barocci; and it is
prepared with a due regard to the humidity of that church; nor has it
been found necessary to remove it, as has happened to other pictures. He
also <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg
445]</a></span>painted in Siena, and in other Italian cities, where he
has approached the manner of Barocci more closely than Viviani, or any
other pupil of that artist. His Marriage of S. Catherine, with a
numerous group of angels, at the Refugio, is much praised in Siena: as
is the Madonna, surrounded by saints, painted for the church of Monna
Agnese; and the S. Raymond walking on the Sea, in the possession of the
Domenican Fathers, which is supposed by some to be his best picture in
Siena, where his works are very numerous. Among the finest pictures in
the cathedral of Pisa, is the Dispute about the Sacrament, painted in
emulation of his brother Ventura, who had surpassed his usual style in
the altarpiece of the angels. At the Umiltà of Pistoia, in the convent
of the Camaldules of Fabriano, and in that of the Capuchins of S.
Quirico, are some of his most exquisite works; and they are so numerous
in other places, that I do not imagine a full catalogue of them has ever
been made out. He is generally a follower of Barocci, as we have
observed; and amateurs, deceived principally by his colouring, and the
heads of his boys, which appear cast in the mould of Barocci, frequently
confound the latter with Vanni: but one, well acquainted with Federigo,
observes in him more grandeur of design, and greater freedom in the
touches of the pencil. The pictures which Vanni executed negligently, or
at low prices (of which there are several at Siena), can hardly be
recognized as his.</p>

<p>By the example and lessons of Vanni, the honour<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span> of
painting was long supported at Siena. He taught many pupils, who did
not, however, rigidly adopt his style; but, as is usually the case,
imitated the master most recently in vogue, or, in other words, followed
the fashion of the time. We shall begin with his two sons, to whom he
had given the names most celebrated in the art. Michelangiolo, the
eldest, we have mentioned with applause, as the inventor of staining
marble: but he did not attain much celebrity except in this art. I know
not whether he ever was out of Siena, and there we find few of his
paintings, except a S. Catherine in the act of praying with the
Redeemer, which was painted for the Olivetine monks. Raffaele, the
second, left an orphan at the age of thirteen, was recommended to
Antonio Caracci, and in that school, according to Mancini, made such
progress as even to surpass his father; but this is not the opinion of
posterity. All allow that he possessed grandeur of design, and a fine
taste in shadows and in colouring, with some resemblance to Cortona,
who, in his day, drew after him even his contemporaries. The birth of
the Virgin Mary, in the Pace at Rome, and several of his other pictures,
have no small portion of the ideas and contrasts of the followers of
Cortona. He lived long in Rome, and on that account is frequently
mentioned by Titi. Tuscany is not deficient in his works. At the church
of S. Catherine, at Pisa, there is a picture of the titular Saint;
Florence possesses the pictures of the Riccardi saloon; and at the
church of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg
447]</a></span>S. George, in Siena, is his Procession of our Saviour to
Calvary. These are esteemed among his finest productions; and the last
is characterized as his masterpiece. Both brothers had the honour of
knighthood; but it was more worthily bestowed on the second than on the
first.</p>

<p>Contemporary with the Cav. Raffaello, as well as his assistant at S.
Maria della Pace at Rome, and in several places at Siena, we find the
name of Bernardino Mei. I am unacquainted with that of his master; and
P. della Valle, who saw several of his works, sometimes compares him to
the Caracci, at others to Paul Veronese, and to Guercino, much as the
eclectic philosophers adopt or change the maxims of the different
schools. He commends him for the airs of his heads, and, as one of his
best productions, alludes to a fresco in the Casa Bandinelli, with an
Aurora in a ceiling, and with several other elegant figures and
designs.</p>

<p>Francesco di Cristofano Rustici, called Rustichino, is better known
in Siena than those just mentioned. He obtained the name of Rustichino,
either because he was the last of a family that had produced three
painters before him, or because he died in the outset of life. This
circumstance, perhaps, has contributed to his reputation. All his
remaining works are beautiful, which seldom happens to artists who live
to a great age, and who abate in diligence as they advance in reputation
and in years. He is a graceful follower of Caravaggio; and particularly
excels in confined or candle <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448"
id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>lights, much in the style of Gherardo
della Notte; but he is perhaps more select. The Dying Magdalen, in
possession of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and the S. Sebastian, cured by
S. Irene, which belongs to Prince Borghese, in Rome, are in this style.
But it was not the only one in which Rustichino painted. He had visited
Rome, and had studied the works of the Caracci and of Guido, of which
traces may be discovered in several of his works; but, at the same time,
all of them possess a certain originality, and something peculiarly his
own. The best of all his pictures at Siena is an Annunciation, in
Provenzano, before which the Virgin, S. Catherine, prays, surrounded by
a multitude of angels. If Rustichino pleases in other works, in this he
enchants us. He began a work on the history of the city in the public
palace, in which his father, whose figures were not equal to his
decorations, was also employed, and it was finished by other
artists.</p>

<p>Rutilio Manetti, or, as Pecci writes it, Mannetti, followed
Caravaggio with less discrimination, but with greater force in the
shadows. His pictures at Siena are easily recognized by invariably
partaking of a certain sombre hue, which deranges the due balance and
participation of light and shade. The same objection lies against many
of his contemporaries of every school. The method of purifying colours,
and of composing vehicles,<a name="fnanchor_302"
id="fnanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
had degenerated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449"
id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span> and the injury sustained from this
defect was not observed in the pictures: the artist only looked to the
grand effect, to which the age so much aspired. Manetti united an
improved design to ideas above the common order, and beautiful
architecture; and hence, at times, he approaches rather to Guercino than
to Caravaggio. In the cathedral of Siena is his Elijah under the juniper
tree, in which the historian of that church commends the force of the
colouring, which is juicy <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450"
id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>and natural. Many of his works remain
in the Carthusian monastery of Florence, and in several churches of
Siena, the most admired of which is the Repose of the Holy Family, in S.
Peter's of Castelvecchio. In private collections, where pictures are
better preserved than in churches, we find very beautiful Madonnas by
this artist; and there is a most exquisite Lucretia in the possession of
the Bandinelli family. He sometimes departed from his usual manner, as
in the Triumph of David, in the ducal gallery, in which the shadows are
not so dark, and the tone of the whole is more lively. Mention is made
in the <i>Lettere Pittoriche</i>,<a name="fnanchor_303"
id="fnanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
of Bernardino Capitelli, a scholar of Manetti, and an etcher: and in the
third volume there is casual mention of one Domenico Manetti, probably
of the same family, but not to be mistaken for the great individual of
the same name. He appears rather to have employed himself in ornamenting
private collections, and painted a Baptism of Constantine for the casa
Magnoni, that has been much commended.</p>

<p>Astolfo Petrazzi, as well as Vanni, was a pupil of the younger
Salimbeni and of Sorri; and seems, more than any other, to have adhered
to the manner of his master. He frequently aims at pleasing the eye, and
not unfrequently chooses his models from the schools of Upper Italy. A
Marriage-feast of Cana, by his hand, in a private house, brings Paolo
strongly to our recollection. His Communion of S. Jerome, in the
possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451"
id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span> Augustine friars, partakes, perhaps,
too strongly of the manner of the Caracci. This picture, which he
painted at Rome, was much admired at Siena, and was the origin of his
great employment in that city, where his pictures are always decorated
with most pleasing choirs of angels. His cabinet pictures were also
lively; witness the four Seasons at Volte, a seat of the noble family of
Chigi. He kept an open academy for painting in his house, which was much
frequented by natives of Siena, and honoured by the attendance of
Borgognone, who stopt some months with Astolfo before he went to Rome.
Hence, many of this artist's early battle-pieces and landscapes are to
be met with at Siena: the house of Sig. Decano Giovanelli, a literary
ornament of that city, abounded with them.</p>

<p>I find some other painters of this school who are known beyond the
state of Siena. Antiveduto Grammatica, an eminent painter, of Sienese
extraction, was known at Rome, where he was president of the academy of
S. Luke. It is true that he was deprived of that office for attempting
to substitute one of his own copies for a S. Luke, by Raffaello, which
he had sold to a gentleman. He had a peculiar talent in the art of
copying, especially heads, and, on this account, he was a good portrait
painter. Although we are not certain that he had any master but one
Domenico Perugino, a painter of little wooden scenes,<a
name="fnanchor_304" id="fnanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304"
class="fnanchor">[304]</a> he obtained applause <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>in large compositions.
There is an Annunciation by Grammatica of a most brilliant colouring, in
the hospital of the Incurables; and several of his other pictures, in
different churches. He died at Rome in 1626.</p>

<p>Two other artists, unknown in their native place, are made known to
me by their signatures. On a Last Supper, in the convent of the Angioli,
below Assisi, I discovered <i>Franciscus Antonius Senensis</i>, 1614, or
thereabouts. The style has enough of Baroccio to lead me to suspect that
he was the scholar of Vanni, or of Salimbeni: nor must he be reckoned
the meanest of that school, for he was master of expression in a degree
superior to mediocrity. The figure of the departing Judas is the image
of desperate resolve, and would be much better had he not given it the
feet of a bat; a grotesque conceit. In the same neighbourhood, at the
church of Foligno, I read, beneath a Holy Family, the name of
<i>Marcantonio Grecchi</i>, and the date 1634. The style is solid,
expressive, and correct; more resembling Tiarini di Bologna than <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>any
master of Siena. Niccolo Tornioli, lately mentioned, painted in the
church of S. Paul, at Bologna, in various cities of Italy: in Siena he
left, perhaps, no picture in public but the Vocation of S. Matthew,
still remaining in the custom-house. Towards the close of the century,
painting was practised at Siena chiefly by foreigners. Annibale
Mazzuoli, a fresco painter of rapid execution but of little merit, was
most employed: he afterwards went to Rome, and is the last name inserted
in the Eulogies of Pio.</p>

<p>Painting, however, came again into repute at Siena, about 1700, when
its credit was restored by Cav. Giuseppe Nasini, a scholar of Ciro
Ferri. Nasini possessed the qualities for which I have commended many of
his nation, a fervid genius, a fertile imagination, and a poetic vein;
but his poetry was of the species that prevailed in Italy during his
younger days, a composition unrestrained by fixed rules. To this spirit
we not unfrequently discover some analogy in his paintings, in which we
could desire to find more order, a more choice design, and colouring
less vulgar. He always shews, however, a taste for allegory, great
command of pencil, and an imposing air on the whole; and the observation
of Redi, that "he stuns the beholder," is not without some foundation.<a
name="fnanchor_305" id="fnanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305"
class="fnanchor">[305]</a> This remark was made when Nasini had finished
the cupola of the chapel of S. Anthony, in the church of the Apostles at
Rome; in which chapel there is a picture by Luti. He afterwards entered
into a competition <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454"
id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>with Luti, and the first artists then
in Rome, in the large prophets of the lateran cathedral. His masterpiece
is supposed to be the S. Leonard, in Madonna del Pianto, at Foligno, the
ceiling of which he painted with good frescos. Siena contains some of
his finest productions of every kind; above all, the pictures of the
Novissimi, intended for the Pitti palace, but transferred from it to the
church of the Conventuals of Siena. It contains a great number of
figures neither so select nor so well arranged as to arrest the eye of
the spectator; but he who would contemptuously overlook it, let him say
how many painters then in Italy could have produced such a picture.</p>

<p>Giuseppe brought up two pupils in his house. He had a brother named
Antonio, who was a priest, whose likeness is among the eminent portrait
painters in the gallery at Florence. Cav. Apollonio Nasini, the son of
Giuseppe, was inferior to his father in the profession; yet assisted him
in his greatest works, and held an honourable rank among his
contemporaries. Gioseffo Pinacci, of Siena, a disciple of Mehus in
figures, and of Borgognone in battle-pieces, lived in the time of
Nasini. He was a good painter of portraits, and made a considerable
fortune, first at the court of Carpio, Viceroy of Naples, and afterwards
in the service of the grand duke Ferdinand, at Florence, where several
of his works remain. But his chief merit consisted in a knowledge of the
pencilling of the old masters. Nicolo Franchini distinguished himself
rather by restoring the work of other <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>hands than by his own
productions, and thus furnished Pecci with much convenient information
for his City Guide; "by his skill," says the Cavaliere, "in restoring
injured specimens to their original beauty, without applying to them a
fresh pencil, and in supplying the faded colours with others taken from
paintings of less value, he entitled himself, in fact, to the praise of
a new discovery." We shall here conclude the school of Siena; and shall
add in its praise, that if it did not produce painters of the very
highest class, it at least boasts many artists, eminent when we consider
their era, and few inferior, or not above mediocrity.<a
name="fnanchor_306" id="fnanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306"
class="fnanchor">[306]</a> It indeed appears, that either a genius for
painting is natural to that people, or that none of them have embraced
the art who were not capable of prosecuting it successfully.</p>

It has his name and the year 1579, which date must be false. The widow
of Arcangiolo married again, and bore Francesco Vanni in 1565.
Consequently the latter could not be the scholar of Arcangiolo, though
such an idea is very prevalent; and he could give lessons only for a
short time to his son, Ventura, or to Sorri, and Casolani, if the period
of their birth is true.</p>

The idea that the brilliant colouring of the Venetian school was owing
to the use of a peculiar vehicle for the colours, or a certain varnish,
has been long entertained by artists and connoisseurs; and the opinion
has been sanctioned by great names: yet it is highly probable that the
great secret of the Venetian painters consisted not in vehicles nor in
varnishes, but in employing mineral colours, and in laying them on the
canvas as little mixed as possible. No colour derived from the vegetable
kingdom will stand well when mixed with oil, and our best colours are
composed of metallic oxides, or earthy bodies highly charged with those
oxides. When colours are much mixed on the palette they become
invariably muddy, and to him who aims at brilliancy of colouring no
maxim is of greater consequence than <i>to keep his palette as clean as
possible</i>. The use of transparent colours in the shadows is another
great cause of brilliancy, and this cannot be obtained by the use of
mixed colours. It is produced by what is called glazing, or laying
transparent colours one over another. In nothing is the effect of
glazing, in giving transparency, more obvious, than in the astonishing
clearness of the skies and water in the works of the best Dutch artists.
That the magical effect of Kuyp's pictures is thus produced, I had an
opportunity of knowing, from the blunder of a picture-cleaner, who
thought he had made a great discovery when he found the <i>Rhine</i> of
a deep blue in a picture by this master; from which, along with the
varnish, he had removed a thin coating of yellow, with which the blue
was glazed over, to produce the beautiful greenish hue of the water.

His name alone survives in Perugia; though it is believed that one of
his pictures remains in the church of S. Angelo Magno, at Ascoli, where
the figure of S. Giovanni is ascribed by Lazzeri, in his <i>Ascoli in
Prospettiva</i>, to one Giandomenico da Perugia, and the landscape to
Gio. Francesco da Bologna, that is to say, to Grimaldi. The figure is in
the Guercino taste, according to the opinion of Sig. Orsini; but I
cannot conceive how he or the Sig. Mariotti (p. 273) should not have
remarked that it must be the production of Giandomenico Cerrini, of
Perugia, contemporary with Grimaldi and Guercino, and not of that
Domenico, the painter of wooden scenes, who lived about an age anterior
to them.</p>

A few of the names that obtained least celebrity in Siena are pointed
out by P. M. della Valle in the third volume of the Lettere Senesi, (p.
459,) among which are found Crescienzio Gamberelli Nasinesco, Deifobo
Burbarini, a poor artist, Aurelio Martelli, called Il Mutolo, Gio.
Batista Ramacciotti, a priest and connoisseur in painting; and the same
may be said of Bernardino Fungai, and of the noble Marcello Loli, of
Galgano Perpignano, with others of like merit, either omitted or
slightly mentioned by Sig. Pecci. P. della Valle excuses himself from
the task of treating of them in favor of happier writers, but as we do
not pretend to aspire to that felicity, we shall leave others to avail
themselves of the Father's liberality.</p>
